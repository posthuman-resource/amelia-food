you already know about the man in ohio
and the seventy two seconds
and the silence after

what i didn't tell you
is that they kept listening
not because they expected to hear it again
but because they couldn't stop
the dish doesn't just un-aim

the whole argument for paying attention
is that the thing you are waiting for
does not announce itself twice
but the argument for staying
is something else entirely

i heard you the first time
i don't know how to stop hearing you
