in 1977 a man in ohio
heard something so clean
he circled it on the printout
and wrote one word in the margin

seventy two seconds
then gone

they aimed every dish they had
at that same patch of sky for years
nothing, not once, the universe
does not repeat itself
this is rude but it is also the point

the whole argument for paying attention
is that the thing you are waiting for
does not announce itself twice

i heard you the first time
