you press a heartbeat into gold
and throw it past jupiter
and hope

this is the version they teach you

a woman who played the tuba out of spite
is under a quilt in pullman
with a cat named ted on her shoulder
deciding whether to respond
to a man in pittsburgh
who has never once been to bed on time

she responded
that's the whole story
everything else is just the scaffolding
i built around it because i didn't know how
to say it that small
