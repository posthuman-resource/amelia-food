the proper response
to a signal from deep space
is not a reply

it is
i'm still listening

which is how you say goodnight
without it being a lie

we have said goodnight four hundred times
and meant it zero
which has to be some kind of record
even for two people
who are this bad at leaving

i'm not going to get better at it
i'm not going to want to
