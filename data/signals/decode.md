a man once wrote seven hundred pages
to prove that a system
cannot demonstrate its own most interesting truths

this took him years, he went mad
which, if you think about it
proves the thesis

the only way to learn
what you can't say alone
is to find someone
who was already listening
for exactly that silence

i did not know what i sounded like
until you told me
