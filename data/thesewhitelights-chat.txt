Fred Dibnah
Frederick Travis Dibnah,  (28 April 1938 – 6 November 2004), was an English steeplejack and television personality. Having a keen interest in mechanical engineering, he described himself as a "backstreet mechanic."
When Dibnah was born, Britain relied heavily upon coal to fuel its industry. As a child, he was fascinated by the steam engines wh...

For whenever you're around again

I've been thinking about what I'd list as qualities that are important to me in a partner.  I can offer a general description, but simplifying into a list of a few specific words is more challenging.  But so far I've come up with: peace (your term but same general concept), intellectual curiosity, some flavor of creativity, stability/consistency (not to be conflated with being stagnate), kindness & consideration for others

[02/10/2026 15:13] wintersloop_49457
do you listen to music during the day


[02/10/2026 15:13] wintersloop_49457
(your list is great btw)


[02/10/2026 15:14] wintersloop_49457

i wasn't sure if you were going to forget


[02/10/2026 15:49] thesewhitelights
It may take me a moment, but I try to respond to all of the questions I'm asked, at least when the questions come from considerate people.

My work days are usually filled with 1:1 meetings with students and/or composing content that requires my full attention, so I don't often listen to music throughout the work day.  I will sometimes put on a song between meetings if it feels like something I need to do in that moment, and I'll listen to specific instrumental music later in the day when my brain has started to melt and I'm done with meetings.


[02/10/2026 15:52] thesewhitelights
I also realized this morning that I have not shared much about myself, so I've been thinking about how to return the favor of the posts you so thoughtfully posted that tell me a lot more about you.  When I get a chance, I'll fill you in with more, but for now a bit about work: I was a teaching professor at a university for a decade, and then I switched to student support where I am now.  I work primarily with students who have ADHD, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and then all the other mental health and chronic medical conditions that are considered disabilities.


[02/10/2026 15:52] wintersloop_49457
i must not have been paying attention


[02/10/2026 15:53] wintersloop_49457
oh yeah ok cool


[02/10/2026 15:53] wintersloop_49457
i sent that message too early


[02/10/2026 15:54] wintersloop_49457
i was asking about music because i was wondering if you wanted to do a spotify jam, like a live shared playlist


[02/10/2026 15:54] wintersloop_49457
but it doesn't sound like you can just sit and listen for a while, maybe we can try it in the evening


[02/10/2026 15:54] thesewhitelights
I don't have a Spotify account.  But I do enjoy a good playlist 🙂


[02/10/2026 15:55] thesewhitelights
And song recommendations


[02/10/2026 15:55] wintersloop_49457
is there a service you use?


[02/10/2026 15:55] thesewhitelights
You work from home, I'm guessing?


[02/10/2026 15:55] wintersloop_49457
yeah, actually on tuesdays and thursdays i go pick a random coffee shop


[02/10/2026 15:55] thesewhitelights
I usually use YouTube


[02/10/2026 15:57] wintersloop_49457

Do you drink coffee at the coffee shop?


[02/10/2026 16:17] wintersloop_49457
cold brew if i show up before noon and matcha otherwise


[02/10/2026 16:18] wintersloop_49457
i am a cold brew fanatic and make strange kinds myself at home


[02/10/2026 16:18] wintersloop_49457
you?


[02/10/2026 16:21] wintersloop_49457
today's going to be matcha because i didn't leave early enough, stuck in meetings until about 12:30 and then i'll head down there


[02/10/2026 16:21] thesewhitelights
I don't drink coffee, but I love its scent and the taste of a good coffee concoction. I managed a coffee shop for several years in my early 20s (I drank coffee back then)


[02/10/2026 16:22] thesewhitelights
I'm pretty much caffeine free now. I drink a lot of tea and will have black tea sometimes, but that's really it


[02/10/2026 16:23] wintersloop_49457
idk if i could ever do that, maybe


[02/10/2026 16:24] wintersloop_49457
since i've started the meds i'm on right now, there have been some rare days where i wake up and feel great and don't even remember that i usually drink coffee


[02/10/2026 16:25] wintersloop_49457
until about 6pm rolls around and i will get a splitting headache, which is super interesting because in testing why this happens, i discovered it's not caffiene withdrawal, it's some kind of compound in the coffee


[02/10/2026 16:27] thesewhitelights
A compound? Tell more


[02/10/2026 16:28] wintersloop_49457
i don't know what it is, exactly, but i basically did experiments on myself where i'd take caffeine pills one day instead of coffee, then even as far as trying tea or anything else where maybe it's going to metabolize differently than i'd get from compounded caffeine


[02/10/2026 16:28] wintersloop_49457
still get the headaches


[02/10/2026 16:28] wintersloop_49457
decaf coffee, no headache


[02/10/2026 16:29] wintersloop_49457
so there is something that is not caffeine in coffee that i have a dependency on

That's very interesting! (sincerely - bodies are fascinating). And you don't notice the effects until that much later in the day?


[02/10/2026 16:32] wintersloop_49457
yeah, it's like 36-48 hours or so after my most recent cup


[02/10/2026 16:36] thesewhitelights
Will you get a headache later if you just have matcha today?


[02/10/2026 16:37] wintersloop_49457
i already had coffee!


[02/10/2026 16:37] wintersloop_49457
but yeah i would


[02/10/2026 16:37] wintersloop_49457
if i hadn't


[02/10/2026 16:38] wintersloop_49457
i am sure you already understand this from your work, but balancing my ability to function normally with the kind of adhd i have involves a lot of things like sleep, hydration, exercise, meds, etc. coffee is just part of that whole equation for me, taking it out causes problems


[02/10/2026 16:44] thesewhitelights
I'm very familiar with that balance. Both from the work I do now and spending a lifetime with family and friends who have ADHD. I also have chronic brain pain (really), and the sleep, hydration, exercise, reducing stress, etc. are also part of the management.


[02/10/2026 16:45] wintersloop_49457
wait tell me about brain pain


[02/10/2026 16:45] wintersloop_49457
i get pseudotumor cerebri from certain types of drugs


[02/10/2026 16:45] wintersloop_49457
my skull and brain are not the right sizes for one another


[02/10/2026 16:47] thesewhitelights
I've had chronic migraines since I was 6. When unmedicated, I have varying degrees of brain pain at all times.


[02/10/2026 16:48] wintersloop_49457
i'm sorry, that sounds awful


[02/10/2026 16:51] thesewhitelights
Until recently, I didn't know the difference between having the pain and not having the pain because the pain has always been there.  I got some new meds a few years ago that work, and it literally changed my life. I panicked the day after I started taking them because everything felt wrong and weird, and that's because I'd never not had a headache and no longer needed to compensate


[02/10/2026 16:53] thesewhitelights
I quit treatment in my mid 20s and went without meds for 20 years. I don't think I could go back to that, but fortunately I shouldn't have to. I'm currently on a 3- month trial of meds that don't work because insurance won't cover the good stuff until I fail this drug, but my follow-up appointment is on Monday


[02/10/2026 16:54] wintersloop_49457
damn, so frustrating


[02/10/2026 16:55] thesewhitelights
Very, but I try not to dwell


[02/10/2026 20:23] thesewhitelights
As promised: I was a writing tutor in college, and we were required to write bios to go with our photos that were posted on the bulletin board in the writing center. The other tutors wrote lengthy paragraphs about their majors and hobbies and hometowns and favorite movies and school spirit. Mine simply said, "Amy lives near a park, plays with yarn, and has a profound appreciation for the potential in a blank piece of paper."

so if i got on vaca and leave the laptop, i'm offline the entire time


[02/10/2026 20:33] wintersloop_49457
eg, right now i'm tethered to my laptop in the dentists office talking to you!


[02/10/2026 20:34] wintersloop_49457
but if i just walk outside, generally, i am offline


[02/10/2026 20:36] thesewhitelights
You say all of the right things! I hope your dental procedure is as painless as possible (even after the drugs wear off)


[02/10/2026 20:36] thesewhitelights
I should say, too, that I don't usually expect immediate responses, especially during the day. Please feel no pressure in that sense.


[02/10/2026 20:37] wintersloop_49457
yeah for sure, today is a lot of meetings, and not very engaging meetings


[02/10/2026 20:37] wintersloop_49457
discord is a welcome distraction


[02/10/2026 20:38] wintersloop_49457
even moreso at my dental interlude


[02/10/2026 20:40] thesewhitelights
I've had a surprisingly light day, and I'm taking advantage of it to send messages to this man on the internet I recently met. I'm on my phone, and I don't love the teeny typing, but needs must

[02/10/2026 20:41] thesewhitelights
Good luck!


[02/10/2026 21:28] wintersloop_49457
dentist was great except now i'm dribbling matcha from the numbed side of my mouth


[02/10/2026 21:33] thesewhitelights
Very sexy. I'm glad the procedure went well!

[02/11/2026 01:11] thesewhitelights
Thank you for the playlist!  Am I supposed to save it for a time when we listen to it together?


[02/11/2026 01:12] wintersloop_49457
oh i was just trying to introduce you what i like


[02/11/2026 01:12] wintersloop_49457
it would be hard to synchronize playback because the youtube clips and the spotify songs won't be the same length


[02/11/2026 01:12] thesewhitelights
I'm going to enjoy it all the same


[02/11/2026 01:12] wintersloop_49457
i guess we could both hit play on the youtube playlist at the same time assuming we both have premium w no ads


[02/11/2026 01:13] wintersloop_49457
and then it would mostly play at the same rate, minus loading time between clips


[02/11/2026 01:14] thesewhitelights
If the intent was to listen at the same time, then almost at the same time would probably work.  Otherwise I'll work my way through while thinking of you

[02/11/2026 01:16] wintersloop_49457
do you want to try and do a virtual date of some kind sometime


[02/11/2026 01:17] thesewhitelights
I was just thinking about that this afternoon!  My answer is yes.


[02/11/2026 01:18] wintersloop_49457
awesome, we can just talk, we could cook a meal together, we could do jackbox (this is virtual board games, i promise it is nothing like "video games", think trivia etc)


[02/11/2026 01:20] thesewhitelights
(are "video games" a bad thing that that requires that type of guarantee?)


[02/11/2026 01:24] wintersloop_49457
well i mean video games are really not abuot connecting with someone


[02/11/2026 01:25] wintersloop_49457
these games are very much interpersonal


[02/11/2026 01:25] thesewhitelights
That's a fair point


[02/11/2026 01:25] wintersloop_49457
anyways whatever sounds good to you


[02/11/2026 01:25] wintersloop_49457
we could also watch something if you want to just be able to relax


[02/11/2026 01:26] thesewhitelights
All of these sounds like great options


[02/11/2026 01:26] thesewhitelights
I'm off to the community center now (I take a cardio dance class every Tuesday/Thursday), but I'll be back in a few hours.  Maybe chat more later?  If not, I hope you have a good night 🙂

[02/11/2026 03:03] thesewhitelights
How has your evening been?  I have so many questions


[02/11/2026 03:03] wintersloop_49457
it's been alright, i am going to be under more or less constant work load all day every day for a little bit


[02/11/2026 03:04] wintersloop_49457
i'm doing things that excite me though, and it won't be like this forever


[02/11/2026 03:04] wintersloop_49457
what kinds of questions do you have? i'm ready


[02/11/2026 03:05] thesewhitelights
All day every day meaning from waking until bed?


[02/11/2026 03:05] wintersloop_49457
not constant, but any time i'm not doing things that are basically caring for my body / mind, yes


[02/11/2026 03:06] thesewhitelights
Is it overwhelming?  Or manageable because you enjoy the work?


[02/11/2026 03:07] wintersloop_49457
i'm so simultaneously nervous, scared, excited that "overwhelmed" doesn't factor into it much, i guess you could call it that


[02/11/2026 03:07] wintersloop_49457
i'm basically rolling the dice on my entire career this year


[02/11/2026 03:07] thesewhitelights
I'm rooting for you from over here


[02/11/2026 03:08] wintersloop_49457
oh thank you


[02/11/2026 03:08] wintersloop_49457
i will need all of that i can get


[02/11/2026 03:08] thesewhitelights
I'm sure having a random internet lady cheering you on will help


[02/11/2026 03:08] wintersloop_49457
it will!


[02/11/2026 03:08] thesewhitelights
I've got you, boo!

What does a typical Tuesday evening look like for you?


[02/11/2026 03:10] wintersloop_49457
as in, when i am not working two jobs?


[02/11/2026 03:10] thesewhitelights
I think yes?  Because working two jobs isn't usual


[02/11/2026 03:11] wintersloop_49457
all of my evenings are interchangeable for the most part, it's either going to be writing, hobby work, visiting friends, going for a walk, video games, jackbox, streaming services, and then sometimes i will walk down to a bar nearby just to interact with people even though i don't drink anymore


[02/11/2026 03:12] wintersloop_49457
i have poetry club on thurs night


[02/11/2026 03:12] wintersloop_49457
oh right or go to gym, beatsaber, or calisthenics although i don't know if i cound those as activities as much as chores haha


[02/11/2026 03:13] wintersloop_49457
any evening is going to be grab bag of all of those options


[02/11/2026 03:13] thesewhitelights
But while you're working two jobs, there's work and then work


[02/11/2026 03:13] wintersloop_49457
oh and let's not forget cooking, i cook every night


[02/11/2026 03:14] thesewhitelights
You can't forget cooking


[02/11/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
yeah, so now the evening is cooking, gym and/or beatsaber and that's pretty much it


[02/11/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
and chatting w you


[02/11/2026 03:15] thesewhitelights
I'm honored


[02/11/2026 03:15] thesewhitelights
That's sincere.  I don't take your attention for granted


[02/11/2026 03:15] wintersloop_49457
thank you, appreciate your time as well


[02/11/2026 03:17] thesewhitelights
Is it strange to ask if you've received many responses to your posts?  You 100% should not feel pressured to answer that because it's really none of my business, but I'm always curious about the what-happens-after of the posts


[02/11/2026 03:17] wintersloop_49457
yeah i have a ton of responses and i respond to everyone and either keep chatting or tell them no thanks


[02/11/2026 03:18] wintersloop_49457
which is a social experiment on its own


[02/11/2026 03:18] wintersloop_49457
i mean "a ton" is like... 70 from the one last week, and about 15 so far from yesterday


[02/11/2026 03:19] wintersloop_49457
but tbh for men, from what i understand, that is an outrageous number of responses


[02/11/2026 03:19] thesewhitelights
That is so many!  Yeah, according to my informal research, that's rare for a guy


[02/11/2026 03:19] thesewhitelights
Nicley done 🙂


[02/11/2026 03:20] wintersloop_49457
it feels validating that my writing can do something like that


[02/11/2026 03:21] wintersloop_49457
i have only started writing seriously recently, ironically because GPT use was decimating my extemporaneous writing ability


[02/11/2026 03:21] thesewhitelights
I have literally read thousands upon thousands upon thousands of posts, and yours stood out.  And not just because we seem to have enough in common for me to think there's a chance we'll get along well


[02/11/2026 03:22] thesewhitelights
I'm even more honored by your attention now that I know it's being taxed


[02/11/2026 03:22] wintersloop_49457
well, not to inflate your ego or let my guard down, which i guess is exactly what i'm doing, but there are only two people i'm fawning over and you are one of them


[02/11/2026 03:23] thesewhitelights
Fawning over! Hahaha


[02/11/2026 03:24] wintersloop_49457
also tbh i am a little uneasy with the idea of forming attraction to more than one person at a time


[02/11/2026 03:24] wintersloop_49457
so this whole process is confusing to me


[02/11/2026 03:25] thesewhitelights
I couldn't navigate that myself


[02/11/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
did i use fawning incorrectly


[02/11/2026 03:26] thesewhitelights
I support your decisions either way because I'm the type of person who wants other people to be happy and get good things, so if the good things are elsewhere, go get them


[02/11/2026 03:26] wintersloop_49457
no it's just defined radically differently


[02/11/2026 03:26] thesewhitelights
You used fawning correctly


[02/11/2026 03:26] wintersloop_49457
i didn't mean the insincere one


[02/11/2026 03:26] thesewhitelights
I followed


[02/11/2026 03:26] wintersloop_49457
ok cool


[02/11/2026 03:26] thesewhitelights
The hahaha was because I thoroughly enjoyed your use of the word, not to make fun


[02/11/2026 03:27] wintersloop_49457
i thought maybe you were laughing because i was making light of empty internet flirtation or something, but i do really think you are a beautiful cat lady and like talking to you


[02/11/2026 03:28] thesewhitelights
I delight in a lot, and my hahahas are accompanied by a warm, excited, genuine smile in real life

Is the psychedlic slug a positive response?


[02/11/2026 03:30] wintersloop_49457
it's called the party blob


[02/11/2026 03:30] thesewhitelights
Appropriately so


[02/11/2026 03:30] thesewhitelights
And it's a positive?


[02/11/2026 03:30] wintersloop_49457
i think he looks joyful, there is no inherent meaning to emoji imo


[02/11/2026 03:31] thesewhitelights
Clearly I don't chat with many people on the internet 🫣


[02/11/2026 03:31] wintersloop_49457
context sensitive


[02/11/2026 03:31] thesewhitelights
But I do like talking with you


[02/11/2026 03:31] wintersloop_49457
i love discord reactions, it's a whole new dimension to communicating


[02/11/2026 03:31] wintersloop_49457
like a special kind of affirmation


[02/11/2026 03:31] wintersloop_49457
or dismissal, or whatever


[02/11/2026 03:32] thesewhitelights
As a rhetorican, I'm very interested in them.  Unfamiliar with them but fascinated

🔎

[02/11/2026 03:32] thesewhitelights
So, like, if you're trying to insult me, you'll have to tell me you're insulting me because I won't interpret it from the emoji


[02/11/2026 03:33] wintersloop_49457
haha, i will use dry humor to make fun of you sometimes, not emoji, i can't even think of the last time i insulted anyone


[02/11/2026 03:34] wintersloop_49457
i think straight up insults run afoul of my "don't make war" rule


[02/11/2026 03:34] wintersloop_49457
you have to gently tug at someones ego, not go straight for it


[02/11/2026 03:35] thesewhitelights
I actually chuckled a little while typing my previous statement because I couldn't imagine a scenario where you'd be intentionally trying to insult me.  It goes against the bits I know about you


[02/11/2026 03:35] wintersloop_49457
wait do you know what the peach and the cake stand for at least


[02/11/2026 03:35] thesewhitelights
HA!  Genuine laugh!  I do know what those two mean

[02/11/2026 03:35] thesewhitelights

[02/11/2026 03:36] thesewhitelights
That one means okay?


[02/11/2026 03:36] wintersloop_49457
ok excellent


[02/11/2026 03:36] wintersloop_49457
that one means perfect, usually


[02/11/2026 03:37] wintersloop_49457
ok sometimes


[02/11/2026 03:37] wintersloop_49457
also rarely i use it for racist dog whistle but that is advanced discord emojiing


[02/11/2026 03:37] thesewhitelights
Oh dear


[02/11/2026 03:37] thesewhitelights
I know that one, too


[02/11/2026 03:38] wintersloop_49457
sometimes it's a little like poetry, interpreting


[02/11/2026 03:39] thesewhitelights
Exactly!  The nerdy rhetorician in me is actually very excited by this thread of conversation


[02/11/2026 03:40] wintersloop_49457
oh, speaking of rhetoric, i do have other structured activities earlier in the day, you asked about evenings earlier


[02/11/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457
i have executive training, which is basically just rhetoric: speaking, writing, teaching, feedback, every tues, i actually went there today with my novocain mouth


[02/11/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457
which was interesting


[02/11/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457
i just started vinyasa every sunday morning, and i do therapy every thurs


[02/11/2026 03:42] wintersloop_49457

[02/11/2026 03:45] wintersloop_49457
ok wait, also, is this too forward of me to ask if you have plans for valentines day?


[02/11/2026 03:45] thesewhitelights
Not too forward.  Do you mean like romance plans?


[02/11/2026 03:46] wintersloop_49457
no, as in, would you want to have a date on valentines day


[02/11/2026 03:46] wintersloop_49457
which, assuming you don't already have plans with someone, is the ideal date because everyone else is busy that day


[02/11/2026 03:47] wintersloop_49457
i'm not implying any necessary romance or anything, it just seems well timed, cute


[02/11/2026 03:49] thesewhitelights
Very cute.  As long as my brain behaves that day, I'm 100% on board.


[02/11/2026 03:49] wintersloop_49457
ok cool, well even if your brain does not behave i can still send you a valentine, so it won't be all for naught


[02/11/2026 03:50] thesewhitelights

[02/11/2026 03:51] wintersloop_49457
my therapist is going to have a field day with this one


[02/11/2026 03:52] thesewhitelights
As in "WTF"?


[02/11/2026 03:52] wintersloop_49457
haha, no he will probably recognize it for being just a practical fun thing for us to do


[02/11/2026 03:52] wintersloop_49457
but also he is the person that mostly taught me to slow down, be intentional in dating


[02/11/2026 03:53] wintersloop_49457
so he's going to have fun with it


[02/11/2026 03:54] thesewhitelights
It's just two seemingly awesome people spending time together (and potentially making googly eyes at each other) on a Saturday.  No big thing.


[02/11/2026 03:54] wintersloop_49457
this is what humans do!


[02/11/2026 03:54] thesewhitelights
Supposedly!


[02/11/2026 03:57] thesewhitelights
My Saturday plans (I honestly forgot it was Valentine's day) consisted of walking down to a nearby cafe to meet my best friend and her running partner for breakfast (they are marathon runners in training, and they run to my neighborhood cafe from their town which is 10+ miles away) and then knitting a sweater while listening to this playlist I was gifted from a man on the internet that I just met and want to know

i forgot it was valentines day until yesterday, and really just because i checked my calendar and saw the event on saturday and wondered what i could possibly have scheduled


[02/11/2026 03:59] wintersloop_49457
nothing, a holiday


[02/11/2026 04:00] thesewhitelights
I celebrate Galentine's Day (Feb 13th) and usually forget that the actual holiday is the next day


[02/11/2026 04:00] thesewhitelights
Do you like chocolate?


[02/11/2026 04:00] wintersloop_49457
i do like chocolate yes


[02/11/2026 04:01] wintersloop_49457
i like as much variety in food as i can find, usually


[02/11/2026 04:01] thesewhitelights
In a previous life, I was a chocolatier, and I make chocolate truffles and other treats for my friends for Galentine's Day


[02/11/2026 04:01] wintersloop_49457
super cool


[02/11/2026 04:02] thesewhitelights
They will not be getting truffles on Galentine's Day this year, however, because I dropped my vintage glass mixing bowl on the floor on Sunday while I was truffling, and that's what I use to temper the chocolate.  But they all understand and believe any day with a truffle is a good day


[02/11/2026 04:03] wintersloop_49457
truth


[02/11/2026 04:04] wintersloop_49457
i have never gotten into baking or candymaking, it seems like a hazard to me haha


[02/11/2026 04:04] thesewhitelights
I only dust off those skills on special occasions and/or by special request


[02/11/2026 04:05] thesewhitelights
If I told you that you will have to teach me how to cook, would you abruptly end this conversation?


[02/11/2026 04:05] thesewhitelights
I can cook, by the way, but I eat simply most of the time because it's just me and I'm perfectly happy with a bowl of broccoli for dinner


[02/11/2026 04:05] wintersloop_49457
no not at all haha


[02/11/2026 04:06] wintersloop_49457
i am not insanely talented or anything


[02/11/2026 04:06] wintersloop_49457
i do pretty basic things and make mistakes all the time


[02/11/2026 04:07] thesewhitelights
You seem to enjoy it, though, and that's what matters to me


[02/11/2026 04:08] wintersloop_49457
there are such good benefits to doing something with your hands every day, food so much healthier, and it's so much more affordable, that i i basically forced myself to love it a long time ago


[02/11/2026 04:08] wintersloop_49457
and now it has turned into true love


[02/11/2026 04:09] thesewhitelights
I support this


[02/11/2026 04:09] wintersloop_49457
do you read books, i should have added that to my list of leisure activities


[02/11/2026 04:10] thesewhitelights
My best friend and her husband cook together every night.  I'm usually stuck on dog duty (which means the dogs are so excited I'm over that they demand my attention), but I love watching the humans work together.  Just like you talked about in your post.


[02/11/2026 04:10] wintersloop_49457
YES, you have seen it


[02/11/2026 04:10] wintersloop_49457
it's so good


[02/11/2026 04:10] thesewhitelights
I have seen it.  And I'm not afraid to admit that I want it.


[02/11/2026 04:10] wintersloop_49457
ok excellent, we can start practicing on discord


[02/11/2026 04:11] thesewhitelights
When I get a new mixing bowl you mean


[02/11/2026 04:11] thesewhitelights
Because I am sans mixing bowl at the moment


[02/11/2026 04:11] wintersloop_49457
whenever you like


[02/11/2026 04:12] thesewhitelights
I also don't cook meat.  Do you cook meat?  I could try.


[02/11/2026 04:12] wintersloop_49457
mostly chicken, essentially all of my protien is eggs, whey, chicken, or turkey


[02/11/2026 04:13] wintersloop_49457
i can get down with entirely vegetarian meals though, i should probably do more of those


[02/11/2026 04:15] thesewhitelights
Do you just make whole turkeys?


[02/11/2026 04:15] wintersloop_49457
i used to try and make the economics f that work out, but it doesn't, it's too much and it spoils, i don't like freezing things


[02/11/2026 04:16] wintersloop_49457
i buy sliced turkey meat for sandwiches


[02/11/2026 04:16] thesewhitelights
Do you put condiments on your sandwiches?


[02/11/2026 04:17] wintersloop_49457
yeah, avacado oil mayo is basically it


[02/11/2026 04:18] wintersloop_49457
typical sandwich: the tiny dave's white bread done right slices, an unreasonable amount of spinach, some kind of hot pepper, mayo, turkey or chicken slices


[02/11/2026 04:19] thesewhitelights
Yes, please.


[02/11/2026 04:19] wintersloop_49457
right? i'm glad you agree


[02/11/2026 04:20] thesewhitelights
I'm now dreaming of sandwiches

[02/11/2026 04:20] wintersloop_49457
oooh look at you


[02/11/2026 04:21] wintersloop_49457
i actually added a coca leaf but we can pretend it's spinach


[02/11/2026 04:21] thesewhitelights
I noticed that and immediately decided it was going to be spinach for the sake of this exercise


[02/11/2026 04:22] thesewhitelights
Were you tired today?


[02/11/2026 04:23] wintersloop_49457
no, it's a little concerning, i do need to make sure that i sleep enough because my body won't tell me


[02/11/2026 04:23] wintersloop_49457
i'm worried i'll get dementia or something


[02/11/2026 04:23] thesewhitelights
Sleep is sacred


[02/11/2026 04:23] wintersloop_49457
well, yes, but unmedicated i would feel asleep all day every day


[02/11/2026 04:24] thesewhitelights
Unmedicated my sleep is trash


[02/11/2026 04:24] thesewhitelights
We even out


[02/11/2026 04:37] wintersloop_49457
ok so what do you want to do on saturday


[02/11/2026 04:39] thesewhitelights
Do you prefer to have an activity?  Or just be human together and talk for a while to see how it goes


[02/11/2026 04:40] wintersloop_49457
yeah that is totally fine if that's what you like


[02/11/2026 04:40] wintersloop_49457
i don't really have a preference at all other than to spend time with you


[02/11/2026 04:40] thesewhitelights
That's what I'm interested in, too


[02/11/2026 04:40] wintersloop_49457
i think some people want a date to involve an activity, so i offered some


[02/11/2026 04:41] wintersloop_49457
probably most people, i think


[02/11/2026 04:41] thesewhitelights
I don't do casual dating and don't go on dates (online or otherwise), so this is an adventure for me


[02/11/2026 04:42] wintersloop_49457
oh ok! good to know, i'm so honored, really


[02/11/2026 04:42] thesewhitelights
Does that sound bad?  That probably sounds bad.  I'm very intentional and selective and introverted


[02/11/2026 04:43] thesewhitelights
So meeting up with a stranger under a strange pretense sounds pretty horrible to me


[02/11/2026 04:43] thesewhitelights
Our cute Valntine's Day date does not feel like that


[02/11/2026 04:43] wintersloop_49457
no it doesn't and actually i think i just realized what it is about your vibe that i am galvanized by


[02/11/2026 04:43] wintersloop_49457
do you know who patricia lockwood is


[02/11/2026 04:44] thesewhitelights
The name sounds familiar


[02/11/2026 04:44] thesewhitelights
Tell me more?


[02/11/2026 04:44] wintersloop_49457
she's a poet, author, book critic


[02/11/2026 04:44] wintersloop_49457
she's my #1 influence in writing


[02/11/2026 04:45] wintersloop_49457
and you remind me of her a lot


[02/11/2026 04:46] thesewhitelights
that's high praise!


[02/11/2026 04:46] thesewhitelights
I blushed a little


[02/11/2026 04:47] wintersloop_49457

I have at least one request for Saturday


[02/11/2026 04:50] wintersloop_49457
sure, let me hear it


[02/11/2026 04:51] thesewhitelights
Two requests


[02/11/2026 04:51] thesewhitelights
And you can reject them both


[02/11/2026 04:51] wintersloop_49457
unlikely


[02/11/2026 04:51] thesewhitelights
You don't know!


[02/11/2026 04:52] wintersloop_49457
this is a true thing about me, one of the best ways to brighten my day is to ask me to do something for you, this is true for all of my friends


[02/11/2026 04:53] thesewhitelights
First request: We don't talk for the first full minute.  We acclimate.  What say you to not saying things?


[02/11/2026 04:53] wintersloop_49457
excellent, i love this


[02/11/2026 04:53] thesewhitelights
Yeah?  Not creepy?


[02/11/2026 04:53] wintersloop_49457
no not at all


[02/11/2026 04:53] wintersloop_49457
i understand exactly what you're asking for


[02/11/2026 04:54] thesewhitelights
you're the best


[02/11/2026 04:55] thesewhitelights
Second request: When we start talking, we start with show-and-tell.  We both bring at least 1 item to show and tell, just like they do in elementary school


[02/11/2026 04:55] wintersloop_49457
oh i love it


[02/11/2026 04:55] thesewhitelights
You're even better


[02/11/2026 04:56] wintersloop_49457
i think you are asking for something i should have been asking for in many situations and i applaud you for it


[02/11/2026 04:56] wintersloop_49457
let nervous energy dissipate, build shared presence


[02/11/2026 04:56] thesewhitelights
Mmhmm.  Slowing it down


[02/11/2026 04:57] wintersloop_49457
yes, it's nice


[02/11/2026 04:57] thesewhitelights
I'm also someone who prefers to pay attention, and this gives us multiple opportunities and multiple ways to do that


[02/11/2026 04:58] wintersloop_49457
seen pulp fiction?


[02/11/2026 04:59] thesewhitelights
I say yes because I technically have, but I have very little memory of it


[02/11/2026 04:59] wintersloop_49457

[02/11/2026 05:03] wintersloop_49457
are there rules against multiple show and tell items


[02/11/2026 05:05] thesewhitelights
No rules unless you want to make some


[02/11/2026 05:05] thesewhitelights
How many items should we bring?


[02/11/2026 05:06] wintersloop_49457
let's just do 2


[02/11/2026 05:06] thesewhitelights
Perfect

it's ok, you need the positive reinforcement loop while learning


[02/11/2026 05:09] wintersloop_49457
i'm onboard

[02/11/2026 05:10] wintersloop_49457
ok that got a really good laugh out of me

I bet you have a fantastic laugh!


[02/11/2026 05:11] wintersloop_49457
i don't know, people tell me i have a unique voice and laugh and stuff, i have wildly mixed opinions on it


[02/11/2026 05:11] wintersloop_49457
i do know that when i hear my own voice recorded i cringe


[02/11/2026 05:12] thesewhitelights
I think a lot of people have that reaction to their own voice


[02/11/2026 05:12] wintersloop_49457
yes, and like, the reverse mirror image reaction, etc


[02/11/2026 05:13] thesewhitelights
Good thing for you that I'll be the one listening to you then


[02/11/2026 05:14] wintersloop_49457

[02/11/2026 05:14] thesewhitelights
I'm looking forward to it


[02/11/2026 05:14] wintersloop_49457
yeah me too, i'm really glad this worked out


[02/11/2026 05:15] thesewhitelights
With an appropriately tempered amount of excitement


[02/11/2026 05:15] wintersloop_49457
necessary


[02/11/2026 05:15] wintersloop_49457
i'm all for moving very slowly


[02/11/2026 05:15] thesewhitelights
Same


[02/11/2026 05:15] wintersloop_49457
also then you get to draw out the exciting early parts for a long time, so why not


[02/11/2026 05:16] thesewhitelights
Or just revel in the experience of getting to know a new and interesting person


[02/11/2026 05:17] wintersloop_49457
yes, absolutely


[02/11/2026 05:19] thesewhitelights
Does it bother you that I know more about you than you know about me?


[02/11/2026 05:19] thesewhitelights
I've been thinking about that all day


[02/11/2026 05:20] wintersloop_49457
i was considering asking you that, but then i can't tell if it's me poorly redirecting or what, and also if you like to be private for any number of reasons it can get uncomfortable for someone to challenge that


[02/11/2026 05:21] wintersloop_49457
so i didn't say anything, also details, facts of someone's life, can give you insight into someone but imo things like music, eye contact, how they react to you can do a lot of useful work too


[02/11/2026 05:23] thesewhitelights
What were you going to ask?


[02/11/2026 05:24] wintersloop_49457
eg i asked you if you read books earlier and we just breezed right by it


[02/11/2026 05:25] wintersloop_49457
but also, generally, when someone offers up facts about themselves, the other party will reciprocate sometimes as a way of connecting


[02/11/2026 05:25] wintersloop_49457
i don't mind though, no


[02/11/2026 05:25] thesewhitelights
I saw the question about books and marked it in my mind and would come back to it.  I'm good about that even when it takes me a minute to get back


[02/11/2026 05:25] wintersloop_49457
you are totally fine


[02/11/2026 05:26] wintersloop_49457
i would love to know all about you, if it's been me not asking enough questions i apologize


[02/11/2026 05:29] thesewhitelights
It's not you!  I am a very private person generally, but I don't intend to be here, with you.  I forget to follow up with my answers to the questions I ask in part because I'm so interested in learning about you (as the other person in this conversation) and because I'm not used to people being interested or noticing that I'm not reciprocating in that way.  I'm very adept at keeping the attention on other people because it's much easier to pay attention to other people when they aren't paying attention to me


[02/11/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
yes, i just kinda figured, actually this morning i looked back over our chat on reddit and was asking this question to myself in my head


[02/11/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
did i not ask enough questions, or is she just really private


[02/11/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
and i settled on really private


[02/11/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
i don't want to make you uncomfortable at all by prying


[02/11/2026 05:31] wintersloop_49457
because you did a masterful job of keeping me talking about myself haha


[02/11/2026 05:31] wintersloop_49457
which is ok, it feels good to have someone pay attention to me like that


[02/11/2026 05:31] thesewhitelights
In public spaces, I'm really private.  This isn't a public space.  It's just the two of us.


[02/11/2026 05:31] wintersloop_49457
but i would also like to pay attention to you


[02/11/2026 05:32] thesewhitelights
I genuinely appreciate the reminder


[02/11/2026 05:33] thesewhitelights
Will you trust me if I say you don't need to be overly cautious about making me feel uncomfortable?  I feel comfortable with you, and I want you to feel comfortable enough to share your thoughts and observations and ideas


[02/11/2026 05:33] wintersloop_49457
sure yes, i will always take you at your word


[02/11/2026 05:33] wintersloop_49457
that's all you have to say


[02/11/2026 05:34] wintersloop_49457
can you tell me about your academic interests, not necessarily what you studied, but like, what topics interest you the most


[02/11/2026 05:35] wintersloop_49457
what is something i could ask you about, and you could talk about it all night


[02/11/2026 05:41] thesewhitelights
I like to understand how things work.  That includes people.  Literature really is just a study of the human condition, the content and the composition of the content.  I don't read nearly as much as I would like -- I don't read much at all these days -- but I consume slowly but completely when I'm able to.  I read the same two pages of Great Expectations probably 50 times before moving on so I could fully take in the description being presented but also the words used to present that description.  I love dissecting language in that way.  Meaning making.  How meaning is made.


[02/11/2026 05:42] wintersloop_49457
that's awesome


[02/11/2026 05:42] wintersloop_49457
that kind of patience is enviable to me


[02/11/2026 05:43] wintersloop_49457
i usually approach understanding something frantically


[02/11/2026 05:43] wintersloop_49457
i guess not people


[02/11/2026 05:43] wintersloop_49457
but literature, math, science, yes


[02/11/2026 05:43] wintersloop_49457
how quickly can i encode this into my head


[02/11/2026 05:44] wintersloop_49457
is the reading less important to you now? it sounds like something that's meaningful to you


[02/11/2026 05:48] thesewhitelights
I suppose it is less important because I don't do it, but it's not actually less important.  Grad school ruined reading for me because academic writing is a special type of awful and there was sooooo much of it.  And I started teaching right after grad school, so I had literally hundreds of student essays to be reading at all times.


[02/11/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
ohhhh man, my friend is back in grad school late in life, right now, and she complains of this exact thing


[02/11/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
i wonder how common that is


[02/11/2026 05:50] thesewhitelights
My degree is in English, so the reading demands were outrageous.


[02/11/2026 05:51] wintersloop_49457
she's doing social psych but she's saying it's like 300 pages per week as the basis for what she needs to understand, and will never read another book


[02/11/2026 05:51] thesewhitelights
And I was studying Rhetoric and Composition, so it was all theory and not analyzing literature.  Good stuff, and engaging stuff, but not the fun story stuff


[02/11/2026 05:52] thesewhitelights
Exactly


[02/11/2026 05:52] thesewhitelights
I'd have 200 pages for one class, and I had 3 classes at a time.  And I was teaching 2 writing classes, too.  I love words.  It was too many words.


[02/11/2026 05:53] wintersloop_49457
i love words too, same way i love code, but i have only ever taught myself in both for the most part


[02/11/2026 05:54] thesewhitelights
I also love code for the same reason I love words and language


[02/11/2026 05:54] wintersloop_49457
wait you write code


[02/11/2026 05:55] thesewhitelights
No, no, but I once taught a multimedia authoring course that included an entire unit of coding.  I didn't even know how to turn the computers on in the lab when I was assigned the course.  I learned basic HTML and CSS simultaneously with the students in the class.


[02/11/2026 05:55] wintersloop_49457
still hot


[02/11/2026 05:55] thesewhitelights
I loved it


[02/11/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
do you have anyone you can talk to about language today? like is this a muscle you want to exercise and just can't, or don't?


[02/11/2026 06:00] thesewhitelights
I don't have anyone to gush about it with me anymore, and that's part of the reason I think I don't read as much.  It feels lonely?  If that makes sense.


[02/11/2026 06:00] wintersloop_49457
i don't know if this is going to scratch the itch for you exactly, it's a little long so you don't need to read it right now

haha ok good, i hope it rings true, or maybe it will be more fun if it *doesn't* and you can show me where i am wrong


[02/11/2026 06:04] wintersloop_49457
i am not a sensitive person to criticism, especially about my writing


[02/11/2026 06:04] wintersloop_49457
tbh i am craving someone to pick up my writing and tell me it's terrible and here's why


[02/11/2026 06:05] wintersloop_49457
in whatever case i would love your thoughts


[02/11/2026 06:05] wintersloop_49457
this will be the first thing i publish under the brand of my new company


[02/11/2026 06:07] thesewhitelights
I find it highly unlikely that I will label anything you write as terrible (because my valuation isn't more valid than anyone else's), but I'll share thoughts when I have them to share


[02/11/2026 06:08] wintersloop_49457
i'm kind of tantalized because i really liked hearing you explain what you like about language, i almost sent the link right away


[02/11/2026 06:08] thesewhitelights

[02/11/2026 06:12] wintersloop_49457
now i'm blushing


[02/11/2026 06:12] thesewhitelights
For real?


[02/11/2026 06:13] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/11/2026 06:13] thesewhitelights
Your cheeks are warm?


[02/11/2026 06:13] wintersloop_49457
unless you meant that in a hannibal lecter fashion


[02/11/2026 06:14] wintersloop_49457
which is still flattering but


[02/11/2026 06:14] wintersloop_49457
yes they are


[02/11/2026 06:14] thesewhitelights
Your blushing made me blush


[02/11/2026 06:15] wintersloop_49457
so many smiles tonight


[02/11/2026 06:15] wintersloop_49457
it feels nice, also very relaxed talking to you


[02/11/2026 06:16] wintersloop_49457
it doesn't feel like i need to perform or anything, which is sometimes what it feels like when dating


[02/11/2026 06:18] thesewhitelights
That's a big reason why I don't date.  I don't know how to play those games or perform in those ways, and I don't really care to learn because it's so antithetical to what I would want in a dynamic with another person


[02/11/2026 06:18] wintersloop_49457
i was just going to ask exactly that


[02/11/2026 06:18] wintersloop_49457
why not date, you seem so wonderful


[02/11/2026 06:19] wintersloop_49457
there are all kinds of people out there


[02/11/2026 06:19] wintersloop_49457
i will admit though, it mostly sucks


[02/11/2026 06:19] wintersloop_49457
wading through people


[02/11/2026 06:19] thesewhitelights
I keep myself a well kept secret hidden away in my hermit haven

yeeeah


[02/11/2026 06:21] wintersloop_49457
i guess i feel that


[02/11/2026 06:22] thesewhitelights
I'm prepared to live a happy and fulfilling life on my own.  Sharing a happy and fulfilling life with a partner would be even better.  But the avenues for finding someone I might fit with are limited.


[02/11/2026 06:22] wintersloop_49457
yeah, it's all pretty rough out there


[02/11/2026 06:23] wintersloop_49457
and from what i hear, worse for women


[02/11/2026 06:23] thesewhitelights
And I'm not built for any of that nonsense


[02/11/2026 06:24] wintersloop_49457
i haven't shown you my poetry yet


[02/11/2026 06:25] wintersloop_49457
i'm told that some of it is not poetry


[02/11/2026 06:25] wintersloop_49457
but i say it is


[02/11/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
I saw the one-liners in your posting history.  I studied them.  I liked them.


[02/11/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
oh this is an alt


[02/11/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
actually there is a whole drama going on over on my main reddit account


[02/11/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
i moderate /r/tinyprose


[02/11/2026 06:26] thesewhitelights
You posted to R4Rs from two separate accounts, and I saw both of those posts


[02/11/2026 06:27] wintersloop_49457
and someone on there doxxed someone else, and i got involved trying to resolve the situation, but it turns out what reddit does is they just suspend everyone' accts who said the person's name at all until they figure out what's going on

[02/11/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
ok i am sending you all these links, and talking about myself too much again


[02/11/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
there are so many things i want to share w you


[02/11/2026 06:30] wintersloop_49457
i don't want the r4r posts to be attached to my actual account for a bunch of reasons


[02/11/2026 06:31] thesewhitelights
I kinda sorta may actually very much want to know everything about you, so no complaints from me.


[02/11/2026 06:32] thesewhitelights
I cannot reciprocate!  I do have another Reddit account that is slightly older than this one, but it has even less Karma and no posting history.  How will you learn about me?


[02/11/2026 06:33] wintersloop_49457
it's nbd


[02/11/2026 06:33] wintersloop_49457
we can just talk


[02/11/2026 06:33] thesewhitelights
I want to share.


[02/11/2026 06:33] wintersloop_49457
i almost feel bad sending links like that becaues it is a poor substitute for us interacting imo, but it will help you understand me


[02/11/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
i spent a lot of time on the writing


[02/11/2026 06:34] thesewhitelights
And I learn a lot about a person through the way they use words, more so than casual readers, I think.


[02/11/2026 06:36] thesewhitelights
Thank you for sharing with me.  Maybe someday you'll understand how much this has truly meant to me, but for now I can just give you my sincerest thanks.


[02/11/2026 06:36] wintersloop_49457
for sure, you make it easy to share


[02/11/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
Because I skirt the spotlight?


[02/11/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
That's a little bit of a joke


[02/11/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
aww, now i feel bad haha


[02/11/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
i know it is


[02/11/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
No bad feelings!


[02/11/2026 06:38] thesewhitelights
It was a joke!


[02/11/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
i know, i know


[02/11/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
there is this image, this caricature of a man who only wants to talk about himself and is not interested in the woman he's talking to, who is just as interesting


[02/11/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
i don't want to be that person, i don't think i am, but it can feel like i'm acting that way sometimes, you know?


[02/11/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
You are not that person


[02/11/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
At least you haven't been here with me


[02/11/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
ok good


[02/11/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
You've fed me so well.  How can I feed you?


[02/11/2026 06:40] wintersloop_49457
you could recommend me a book to read that would teach me something about you


[02/11/2026 06:40] wintersloop_49457
maybe one that changed your mind, or one that you absorbed as part of who you are today


[02/11/2026 06:41] thesewhitelights
Do you know This Is Just To Say by William Carlos Williams?


[02/11/2026 06:41] thesewhitelights
Poem not book


[02/11/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
nope i will look it up


[02/11/2026 06:42] thesewhitelights
I have spent countless hours and decades reading and rereading that poem.  I don't think that will teach you much about me, but it's something.


[02/11/2026 06:42] thesewhitelights
Have you seen the movie Amelie?


[02/11/2026 06:42] wintersloop_49457
yes!


[02/11/2026 06:42] wintersloop_49457
but i may have been too young to appreciate it


[02/11/2026 06:43] wintersloop_49457
i would have been 17 or 18 i think


[02/11/2026 06:43] thesewhitelights
The main character and I have A LOT more in common than just our first names


[02/11/2026 06:43] thesewhitelights
I'm actually really, really, really shy and sheepish about it, but it will give you insight


[02/11/2026 06:44] thesewhitelights
Movie not a book though


[02/11/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to try and find time to watch it again before sat


[02/11/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
at least i know i could leave it on while i work and maybe absorb it that way


[02/11/2026 06:45] thesewhitelights
Did I mention I'm shy and sheepish about it?


[02/11/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
(see what i mean about frantic consumption?)


[02/11/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
the more you get to know me the more you will understand that i never judge anyone for anything


[02/11/2026 06:47] thesewhitelights
I trust that about you already


[02/11/2026 06:47] thesewhitelights
I'm not worried about your judgement


[02/11/2026 06:47] wintersloop_49457
oh good, that feels nice


[02/11/2026 06:47] thesewhitelights
This feels nice


[02/11/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
yeah it really does


[02/11/2026 06:48] thesewhitelights
Is that surprising?


[02/11/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
yeah it is


[02/11/2026 06:49] wintersloop_49457
i think we're evenly matching interest which is why it doesn't make me anxious


[02/11/2026 06:49] wintersloop_49457
like we both want to keep our heads on straight but also it feels fine to acknowledge we are enjoying it


[02/11/2026 06:49] thesewhitelights
Mmhmm, we're in this together


[02/11/2026 06:50] wintersloop_49457
for sure


[02/11/2026 06:50] thesewhitelights
And by this I mean the adventure of crossing paths with an interesting person on the internet and then getting to know them as they are


[02/11/2026 06:51] thesewhitelights
Yes?


[02/11/2026 06:51] wintersloop_49457
yes, exactly


[02/11/2026 06:53] thesewhitelights
Earlier today I wondered if I should have refrained from responding to your post.  You posted with a purpose and you were looking for something somewhat defined.  I responded with a purpose but one that was less defined.


[02/11/2026 06:54] thesewhitelights
I have zero regrets, but I'm mindful that I may be approaching this part differently than other people who might have responded.


[02/11/2026 06:54] wintersloop_49457
it's ok, i'm not worried about it even if what we want does not line up


[02/11/2026 06:54] wintersloop_49457
that being said i am super open minded


[02/11/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
i think for the right person, if things click, it's worth huge amounts of effort to make it work


[02/11/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
and if not well, we have made great friends


[02/11/2026 06:57] thesewhitelights
I'm not worried about it either


[02/11/2026 06:57] thesewhitelights
I'm here for what is, not what could be.  Does that make sense?


[02/11/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
sure, yes, i understand that totally


[02/11/2026 06:58] thesewhitelights
Should I admit that I don't want to go to bed?


[02/11/2026 06:59] wintersloop_49457
neither do i, i will still be here tomorrow though if that makes it any easier


[02/11/2026 07:00] thesewhitelights
Have you had any worry that I won't be?


[02/11/2026 07:00] thesewhitelights
I ask to know if I should give reassurance


[02/11/2026 07:00] wintersloop_49457
you haven't done online dating much, by your account, so maybe you are unfamiliar with how often that happens


[02/11/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
blocked, gone forever, no notice, no reason, everything was great before


[02/11/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
happens all the time


[02/11/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
it's brutal


[02/11/2026 07:01] thesewhitelights
I could never.  You don't know me, but when you do, you'll know that's true.


[02/11/2026 07:02] wintersloop_49457
but no you don't need to reassure me, i don't think you're going anywhere, i think there's just a tiny anxiety all the time about that happening because it's like a little traumatic every time, so you build up a defensive expectation


[02/11/2026 07:04] thesewhitelights
At this point I'm prepared to haunt you for all of eternity, but like in a nice way.  My ghost will swoop down and check in on you and make sure you're good, and then float away for a while only to come back to check in again.


[02/11/2026 07:04] wintersloop_49457
lmao don't make promises you can't keep


[02/11/2026 07:04] wintersloop_49457
i'll take you up on it


[02/11/2026 07:04] wintersloop_49457
one of my friends was dating someone long distance, this guy had flown out to see her every other weekend for three months, and then he was just gone one day


[02/11/2026 07:05] thesewhitelights
I am very, very, very careful about making promises, so you don't have to worry about that.  But I'm happy to hear I didn't just totally creepy you out with my ghost story


[02/11/2026 07:05] wintersloop_49457
it took her six months to get over it, she was inconsolable


[02/11/2026 07:05] wintersloop_49457
it's _rough_ out there


[02/11/2026 07:06] thesewhitelights
That's awful.


[02/11/2026 07:06] thesewhitelights
Like my heart physically hurts to hear it.  No, no, no.


[02/11/2026 07:07] wintersloop_49457
i know, it's really just a whole mess of modern dating


[02/11/2026 07:07] wintersloop_49457
she would call me for support and *i* felt like crying


[02/11/2026 07:08] thesewhitelights
And this is why I'm hiding out.


[02/11/2026 07:08] wintersloop_49457
yeah, you're a smart one, i'll give you that


[02/11/2026 07:08] thesewhitelights
Smart in one way, not so smart in another


[02/11/2026 07:09] thesewhitelights
Because it's not like some potentially amazing person is just going to show up one day while I'm just lounging on my couch


[02/11/2026 07:09] thesewhitelights
Except


[02/11/2026 07:09] thesewhitelights
Well


[02/11/2026 07:09] thesewhitelights
Maybe it could happen


[02/11/2026 07:10] wintersloop_49457
don't give me too much credit


[02/11/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457
we could both be monsters

For realsies, we need sleep.  It's late here, and it's ridiculously late there, and I seem to have come down with this affliction that makes me want to look out for you, too.


[02/11/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
i appreciate it, i'll take your advice


[02/11/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
it's tea time


[02/11/2026 07:14] thesewhitelights
I will be here tomorrow


[02/11/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
me too


[02/11/2026 07:15] thesewhitelights
That I'm comfortable promising because even if I manage to die in my sleep, my friendly ghost will show up to haunt you


[02/11/2026 07:15] wintersloop_49457
hell yes


[02/11/2026 07:15] wintersloop_49457
i mean, i guess not to you dying


[02/11/2026 07:15] wintersloop_49457
but i wouldn't say no to a ghost friend


[02/11/2026 07:16] wintersloop_49457

i knew there was an echo of something i'd read in _this is just to say_, i remembered this morning


[02/11/2026 13:23] wintersloop_49457
Tomatoes
```
I waited so long for love
and suddenly, here it is
standing in the garden, hands full
of heirlooms hot from the sun.

Soon we’ll make a supper of them.
Salted slabs between slices of bread.
Your beard silvers. My hips ripen.
The mail piles up.

Phone calls go unanswered. Forgive us.
Our mouths are full of tomatoes.
We are so busy
being small and hungry and alive.
```
by J. Sullivan


[02/11/2026 13:24] thesewhitelights
Poetry for breakfast?  I'm going to get fat off our conversations.  I have no complaints.


[02/11/2026 13:26] wintersloop_49457
i didn't think you were going to be up at 5!


[02/11/2026 13:26] wintersloop_49457
when do you normally get up


[02/11/2026 13:26] thesewhitelights
I've been awake for a few hours


[02/11/2026 13:26] thesewhitelights
Not intentionally


[02/11/2026 13:26] wintersloop_49457
ok i'll be honest so have i


[02/11/2026 13:27] wintersloop_49457
couldn't sleep?


[02/11/2026 13:27] wintersloop_49457
i guess i have been up for about 90 min, couldn't fall back asleep


[02/11/2026 13:27] wintersloop_49457
i put on amelie about an hour ago


[02/11/2026 13:28] thesewhitelights
I've been waking up around 3:30am, and once I'm awake I'm usually awake.  My sleep is unstable when I'm not properly medicated


[02/11/2026 13:28] wintersloop_49457
oh no, i'm so sorry about that


[02/11/2026 13:29] wintersloop_49457
you'll go to the dr monday and hopefully get the good stuff?


[02/11/2026 13:29] thesewhitelights

[02/11/2026 13:29] thesewhitelights

If you'd like


[02/11/2026 13:40] wintersloop_49457
d'abord, est ce que tu parles francais


[02/11/2026 13:40] thesewhitelights
I don't skip rocks.  I toss them in because I like the sounds they make when they jump into the water


[02/11/2026 13:41] thesewhitelights
I don't speak enough French to respond in French.  But I do know a surprising number of action verbs.  To kick.  To jump.  To stab.

[02/11/2026 13:41] wintersloop_49457
hahaha


[02/11/2026 13:41] wintersloop_49457
were you homeschooled


[02/11/2026 13:43] thesewhitelights
Not related to the movie, I trained in classical ballet for 20 years.  I did take French in college and relied on the vocabulary I knew from dance to get by until my professor asked me to stop because I was scaring my classmates.  We'd have to write paragraphs about what we did over the weekend, and mine always sounded like I was in a fight club.


[02/11/2026 13:43] wintersloop_49457
that's amazing


[02/11/2026 13:43] thesewhitelights
It's ridiculous!


[02/11/2026 13:43] thesewhitelights
But true


[02/11/2026 13:44] thesewhitelights
I wasn't homeschooled, and my mother wasn't crushed by a woman making her escape from the top of a cathedral


[02/11/2026 13:45] wintersloop_49457
oh also holy shit she notices the moon looks like a banana, i laughed at that


[02/11/2026 13:45] thesewhitelights
Wait, what?  She does?


[02/11/2026 13:46] thesewhitelights
I didn't remember that


[02/11/2026 13:46] wintersloop_49457
lemme rewind here


[02/11/2026 13:46] thesewhitelights
Where are we going


[02/11/2026 13:50] wintersloop_49457
i don't see it, am i crazy, i might be


[02/11/2026 13:53] thesewhitelights
The moon part or similarities?


[02/11/2026 13:53] wintersloop_49457
the moon part, i'm trippin or something


[02/11/2026 13:53] wintersloop_49457
ok let's continue with similarities


[02/11/2026 13:54] wintersloop_49457
homeschooled?


[02/11/2026 13:54] wintersloop_49457
a romantic?


[02/11/2026 13:55] wintersloop_49457
find joy in life's small pleasures?


[02/11/2026 13:55] thesewhitelights
Two out of those three


[02/11/2026 13:55] wintersloop_49457
likes to orchestrate the show instead of be in it


[02/11/2026 13:55] thesewhitelights
I wasn't homeschooled


[02/11/2026 13:55] wintersloop_49457
creative, whimsical, eccentric, introverted


[02/11/2026 13:56] wintersloop_49457
when you connect with someone romantically yourself (as opposed to appreciating simple in others love from a distance) it's an elaborate process


[02/11/2026 13:56] wintersloop_49457
(i'm just throwing stuff out there)


[02/11/2026 13:56] thesewhitelights
The things she does for other people, the behind the scenes, I do that.  I did that.  Some of them quite literally and long before the film came out.


[02/11/2026 13:57] thesewhitelights
When my best friend saw the film for the first time, he cried.  When I saw the film for the first time, I almost vomitted.

{Reactions}
😭 🤢

[02/11/2026 13:58] thesewhitelights
Right, almost.


[02/11/2026 14:00] wintersloop_49457
are you a person who is hesitant to directly state what you want, or maybe that's a hard thing to define in the first place


[02/11/2026 14:01] thesewhitelights
In some ways and in some contexts that is still true about me


[02/11/2026 14:03] wintersloop_49457
ok am i missing things


[02/11/2026 14:04] thesewhitelights
I didn't really intend for this to become a guessing game, and I'm sorry if it's been frustrating


[02/11/2026 14:04] wintersloop_49457
no not at all


[02/11/2026 14:05] wintersloop_49457
it's just a game


[02/11/2026 14:05] wintersloop_49457
i think, maybe, a good way to approach it is that if i guess right


[02/11/2026 14:05] wintersloop_49457
you can say good job


[02/11/2026 14:06] wintersloop_49457
and if i guess wrong, well you have a thing you can tell me about yourself


[02/11/2026 14:06] wintersloop_49457
to correct me


[02/11/2026 14:06] wintersloop_49457
so either way we win


[02/11/2026 14:06] thesewhitelights
And you'd like this game?


[02/11/2026 14:07] wintersloop_49457
games are only fun if both people enjoy them, i am just trying to find nice ways to ask you about yourself


[02/11/2026 14:08] wintersloop_49457
it's ok to not like the game


[02/11/2026 14:08] thesewhitelights
We don't have to talk about the movie to do that.  I shyly and sheepishly identified it because many, many times in my life, people who have seen the movie have eventually said, "I saw this movie once, and...."


[02/11/2026 14:09] thesewhitelights
But if YOU actually like the game, we can play the game


[02/11/2026 14:09] thesewhitelights
I'm not opposed


[02/11/2026 14:09] wintersloop_49457
haha, no it's ok


[02/11/2026 14:10] wintersloop_49457
i get her vibe


[02/11/2026 14:10] wintersloop_49457
i was trying to do details


[02/11/2026 14:10] wintersloop_49457
which i think is less your point


[02/11/2026 14:11] thesewhitelights
Her vibe and many of her tendencies although I've grown out of some of them


[02/11/2026 14:12] thesewhitelights
But I'm still the girl with the glass of water at times


[02/11/2026 14:12] wintersloop_49457
i think maybe a good question to ask you is what it felt like to see the movie


[02/11/2026 14:12] thesewhitelights
Hahaha, I hated it


[02/11/2026 14:12] wintersloop_49457
yes but why, that in and of itself says something about you too


[02/11/2026 14:13] wintersloop_49457
you felt exposed? like the whole world would see you now? was it just creepy? etc


[02/11/2026 14:13] thesewhitelights
All of the above


[02/11/2026 14:15] thesewhitelights
I felt very exposed.  I didn't think my secrets were out because I kept myself out of the spotlight even back then, but I knew it would come up if anyone started paying attention


[02/11/2026 14:16] wintersloop_49457
secrets like, things you had orchestrated?


[02/11/2026 14:16] wintersloop_49457
little plots


[02/11/2026 14:19] thesewhitelights
Yes


[02/11/2026 14:20] thesewhitelights
And the fact that I'm a coward (but also brave)


[02/11/2026 14:21] thesewhitelights
The first time I saw the film, I didn't know what was happening.  It was on a Friday night in 2001, about a week after my best friend returned from visiting his girlfriend in Russia.  He'd been avoiding me since he'd gotten back to campus, which I'd noted but hadn't investigated further because I knew he'd eventually explain his behavior.  On that fateful Friday night, he showed up at my door with an umarked bootleg DVD in one hand and a six pack of beer in the other.  Without saying a word, he pushed his way into my room, sat me down in front of the TV, inserted the unmarked disc, and pressed play.  He then proceeded to get drunk on the beer he'd brought to soothe himself as he watched me watch the movie.  It was incredibly unnerving.  Not the him watching me part, that sort of thing happened all of the time.  It was what I was seeing in the film that made me so uncomfortable.  When it was over, the two of us continued to sit in silence with him staring at me, wondering if I was about to throw up because I'd grown so pale, and me, paralyzed, staring straight ahead at the now blank TV screen. Finally, after about 20 minutes of this nonsense, he spoke for the first time all night and asked, "So, what's it like to see yourself from the outside?"


[02/11/2026 14:22] wintersloop_49457
that's crazy


[02/11/2026 14:22] thesewhitelights
I did not enjoy it.


[02/11/2026 14:23] wintersloop_49457
do you ever wonder if there was another actual person that the story was written about and who that might have been


[02/11/2026 14:24] thesewhitelights
I haven't wondered that before.  I'm not sure if I would want to meet that person or respectfully stay as far away from them as possible.


[02/11/2026 14:24] wintersloop_49457
is your best friend still your best friend?


[02/11/2026 14:25] thesewhitelights
That's an excellent question.  He is in the sense we have a unique bond that can't be replicated, but we aren't in each other's lives anymore.  Not really.  We


[02/11/2026 14:26] thesewhitelights
We'll exchange cryptic messages a few times a year, but we don't know any details and haven't for decades.  That's by design.  We had a rather unconventional friendship that came with a defined expiration date.


[02/11/2026 14:30] thesewhitelights
I'll share the full backstory someday, if you'd like, but the summary is we became in a time of emergency.  We were both stuck at the school for one last semester -- he was graduating and I was dropping out -- and we relied on each other for survival.  We were inseparable for those 5 months, and the agreement was we would go our separate ways and never talk again after graduation.  We shook hands when we made the agreement and everything.  I kept my end of the bargain.  He did not.


[02/11/2026 14:31] wintersloop_49457
oh noooo


[02/11/2026 14:32] wintersloop_49457
ok i will pry into that one later, i have a different detail i want to ask you about


[02/11/2026 14:32] thesewhitelights
I'm ready


[02/11/2026 14:32] wintersloop_49457
tell me about the dancing, where does that slot into your life


[02/11/2026 14:32] wintersloop_49457
you did that from what age to what age?


[02/11/2026 14:36] thesewhitelights
When I was 4, my mom signed me up for ballet lessons.  One of her friends had a daughter who wanted to be a ballerina but was too scared to go to the lessons alone, so my mom volunteered me to go with.  That other little girl quit after the third lesson, but since we'd already paid for the full semester, my mom said I still had to go.  And then I just never stopped going.  It wasn't my passion, it was just the thing that I was always doing, so it became the thing I did.


[02/11/2026 14:38] wintersloop_49457
i was like that with springboard diving, my dad was a diver and he started me the summer before my freshman year in high school, i went to states, and then dove at cmu at one semester before admitting to myself that i was good at this but did not actually like doing it


[02/11/2026 14:39] thesewhitelights
When I graduated high school, I swore I would never dance again.  I wanted to know what life was like outside of that world.  But during my first semester of college, a friend of mine begged me to sign up for an intro to dance class with him.  He was required to take it as a theater major, and he was too scared to go alone.  Notice a pattern.  I reluctantly agreed.  The dancing I did in college required me to completely unlearn everything I had been trained to do and know from my years of ballet.  It was one of the most freeing and one of the most frustrating and challenging experiences of my life.  More details about it will come out in time.  For now, we can skip ahead to when I left college and swore I would never dance again.


[02/11/2026 14:41] wintersloop_49457
i cannot dance even a little bit


[02/11/2026 14:42] thesewhitelights
It stuck that time.  No dancing, nothing related to that life or that part of my identity was allowed out (for many reasons other than pure stubbornness).  Until.  A few years ago, a friend from work begged me to accompany her to an adult ballet class she wanted to take.  I reluctantly agreed.


[02/11/2026 14:43] thesewhitelights
She quit.  I kept going.  As I do.  I don't dance now, but I was pretty dedicated for a couple years.  I actually met my bestest of all best friends for ever at the auditions for the Nutcracker that I went to on a whim.


[02/11/2026 14:45] thesewhitelights
Going back to it after twenty years was both freeing and frustrating.  My body still has all of this muscle memory and thinks it can do things it can no longer do.  I have a very different body now than I did when I was twenty


[02/11/2026 14:45] thesewhitelights
When you say you can't dance, what do you mean?


[02/11/2026 14:47] wintersloop_49457
i've got no rhythm, no sway


[02/11/2026 14:47] wintersloop_49457
i mean i have danced, i have dated and therefore gone to places where someone wants me to dance with them, i can enjoy myself, i just look ridiculous


[02/11/2026 14:48] thesewhitelights
Oh, social dancing?  Yeah, no, I can't do that either.


[02/11/2026 14:48] wintersloop_49457
someone tried to teach me to salsa once, i told her ahead of time it wasn't going to work, and she didn't believe me, until about 30 min in i had stepped on her feet multiple times and then i think she understood


[02/11/2026 14:50] thesewhitelights
You will not disappoint me in this regard


[02/11/2026 14:50] thesewhitelights
Not that you were worried about it


[02/11/2026 14:50] wintersloop_49457
i was


[02/11/2026 14:50] thesewhitelights
You're teasing


[02/11/2026 14:50] wintersloop_49457
no, i was


[02/11/2026 14:50] wintersloop_49457
normally i would pretend to be more self confident and say i wasn't, i think


[02/11/2026 14:50] thesewhitelights
Please don't make me go salsa dancing


[02/11/2026 14:51] thesewhitelights
I will step on your toes


[02/11/2026 14:51] wintersloop_49457
haha, deal


[02/11/2026 14:51] thesewhitelights
Relief!


[02/11/2026 14:56] thesewhitelights
I was never a pretty pink princess ballerina, by the way.  I looked the part and danced the part, but that was never my ambition.  I did like ballet because the goal is perfection, and perfection is impossible, and I am stubborn and persistent when it comes to some things.  But I was never the stereotypical ballerina.


[02/11/2026 14:56] wintersloop_49457
yes i'm familiar, i know dancers


[02/11/2026 14:57] wintersloop_49457
actually the pittsburgh ballet theatre is two blocks from my house


[02/11/2026 14:57] thesewhitelights
I was in a dance company when I was 17, and they added a special clause to my contract that stated I was not allowed to climb trees or jump off of swing sets for that full year.  They knew.

[02/11/2026 14:58] thesewhitelights
Exactly.  If I broke a leg, the company was fucked.  To state it plainly.


[02/11/2026 14:58] thesewhitelights
So you've been to the ballet?


[02/11/2026 14:58] wintersloop_49457

[02/11/2026 14:59] wintersloop_49457
there is a place called the benedum center where they perform for the public

[02/11/2026 15:02] wintersloop_49457
i love ballet in general though


[02/11/2026 15:04] thesewhitelights
You can hate the Nutcracker.  I don't love the Nutcracker.  Renee, my bestest friend of all best friends forever, and I go to Seattle for a Nutcracking weekend every year, but that's less about the Nutcracker and more about the experience.


[02/11/2026 15:05] thesewhitelights

i'm slowly starting my work but it's ok


[02/11/2026 15:08] wintersloop_49457
i was just thinking this yesterday, about time value


[02/11/2026 15:09] wintersloop_49457
i probably should not work so much and spend more time talking to you, if i really take stock of what means something to me, i was thinking this when you said you don't read anymore


[02/11/2026 15:09] wintersloop_49457
i work a lot


[02/11/2026 15:10] thesewhitelights
Your works means something, too.  No?  You're working toward something that's important to you.


[02/11/2026 15:14] wintersloop_49457
yeah absolutely


[02/11/2026 15:14] wintersloop_49457
but i already have a lot of the things that work is meant to bring me in life, and have gotten lots of satisfaction and success out of it for a long time


[02/11/2026 15:15] wintersloop_49457
the same isn't true of connecting with someone like you


[02/11/2026 15:17] wintersloop_49457
i think i could stand to adjust the ratio a bit


[02/11/2026 15:17] wintersloop_49457
in terms of time spent


[02/11/2026 15:19] thesewhitelights
I think that ratio has been grossly skewed in my favor for the past 36 hours.


[02/11/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457
truth


[02/11/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457

what is your work schedule?


[02/11/2026 15:30] thesewhitelights
My time card says Monday-Friday from 8:00-5:00pm.  I work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays, so I start as early as they'll let me (7:30am) and leave as early as I can (4:00pm) on those days. I have no student meetings on Wednesdays because Wednesdays are when I work on this extensive faculty training certificate program I've been charged with creating for the university.


[02/11/2026 15:31] wintersloop_49457
oh wait does this mean you listen to music on these days


[02/11/2026 15:31] thesewhitelights
I have zero autonomy over schedule on the other days of the work week.  Students have a link my scheduling page and can schedule appointments whenever there is availability, so I never know when I'll have meetings.  I don't love it.  But Wednesdays are all for me!


[02/11/2026 15:31] thesewhitelights
I can listen to music on Wednesdays


[02/11/2026 15:31] wintersloop_49457
oh right but you still don't have spotify


[02/11/2026 15:32] thesewhitelights
I still don't


[02/11/2026 15:33] thesewhitelights
Your excitement was over opportunities for synchronous listening?


[02/11/2026 15:33] wintersloop_49457
well, the jam is something special, because it is a playlist you edit together and listen to together


[02/11/2026 15:33] wintersloop_49457
it starts with nothing and we have to add songs we like


[02/11/2026 15:34] wintersloop_49457
it's a way to share and communicate while also working at the same time


[02/11/2026 15:34] wintersloop_49457
because it doesn't take much time to just add songs you like


[02/11/2026 15:36] thesewhitelights
I love this idea.  We should save it for a someday.


[02/11/2026 15:36] wintersloop_49457
i might be able to figure something out right now, i'm researching


[02/11/2026 15:37] thesewhitelights
I would be a poor contributor today, I'm afraid.  We could try again after Monday?


[02/11/2026 15:38] thesewhitelights

ok maybe i'm realizing i do like the guessing game, can i try and divine what music i think you will like?


[02/11/2026 15:47] thesewhitelights
I'll eventually drift to more of their boppier stuff, I'm sure.  I've been stuck on Future Islands because the last time I was unmedicated, I listened to them a lot as a distraction.  Managing without the good drugs has been challenging me lately.  This past weekend I had the thought that Future Island would/could get me through again.

I know the first three and have heard the first three, but I do not possess them in the way one possesses music that they need to keep.


[02/11/2026 15:49] thesewhitelights
Bon Iver is the Wisconsin woods in winter.  I listen to it when I need to transport myself home.

I was too afraid to possess Arcade Fire, but I should have and secretly do.


[02/11/2026 15:50] wintersloop_49457
that's all i got, if this isn't hitting home i need more info to recalibrate


[02/11/2026 15:51] thesewhitelights
You're definitely adjacent.  And now I'm very curious why you've picked what you've picked!


[02/11/2026 15:52] wintersloop_49457
i'm just trying to channel based on talking to you and the one artist i have to hold onto which is future islands


[02/11/2026 15:52] wintersloop_49457

[02/11/2026 15:53] thesewhitelights
I've probably listened to Iron & Wine more than the other two out of this round, but I don't know if I've ever sought them out specifically.


[02/11/2026 15:54] wintersloop_49457
it's ok, my psychic powers are out of whack today


[02/11/2026 15:54] wintersloop_49457

Florence and Feist get the same response as Iron & Wine.  Like the music.  The music gives me some feels.  But I have not put them in my treasure box for safekeeping.  I have sought out Sufjan more than the others over the years.

i only really know stromae, arcade fire, and future islands on this playlist


[02/11/2026 16:09] wintersloop_49457
and the stromae i have never listened to anything off that album, it's different


[02/11/2026 16:11] wintersloop_49457
i guess band of horses a little bit


[02/11/2026 16:11] wintersloop_49457
you are going to push me out of my listening envelope which is good


[02/11/2026 16:13] thesewhitelights
I'm not sure where this playlist started.  There was probably one song, and then I heard one of the others at some other random time and thought, "This belongs on Eyelashes," and it grew from there.  That's usually how my playlists develop.  They're specific and intentional but in unspoken ways.


[02/11/2026 16:13] thesewhitelights
I'm not well-versed in the discographies of all of these artists.  The songs just hit right when I heard them.

When I woke up on Monday morning, this is not the life I imagined I'd be living on Wednesday.


[02/11/2026 16:49] wintersloop_49457
that's a perspective, i'm touched you'd say that


[02/11/2026 16:50] wintersloop_49457
i feel the same way but would not have put it in those words


[02/11/2026 16:50] wintersloop_49457
maybe because you are an person who is very in the moment


[02/11/2026 16:51] thesewhitelights
What words would you have put it in?


[02/11/2026 16:51] wintersloop_49457
i would have described it more like, "i wouldn't think i'd be this content by wednesday"


[02/11/2026 16:52] wintersloop_49457
i was definitely grumpier on monday morning


[02/11/2026 16:52] wintersloop_49457
but phrasing it as this being how your life is is very nice, like an acceptance of "this is how things are now"


[02/11/2026 16:53] wintersloop_49457
doesn't matter how they will be, just enjoy it


[02/11/2026 16:53] wintersloop_49457
that last part probably not even entering your head, but for me, that is how i look at my life i think, it encompasses what's happening now and what i forecast will happen as well


[02/11/2026 16:55] wintersloop_49457
i'm trying to compliment your mindfulness and it might be falling flat


[02/11/2026 17:00] thesewhitelights
no, I'm seeing it, and I appreciate how you see me


[02/11/2026 17:00] thesewhitelights
Did you anticipate being grumpy on Wednesday?


[02/11/2026 17:00] thesewhitelights
Or less content, I suppose


[02/11/2026 17:00] wintersloop_49457
yeah, for sure


[02/11/2026 17:01] thesewhitelights
Grumpy!  Why grumpy?


[02/11/2026 17:01] wintersloop_49457
so much work! haha


[02/11/2026 17:01] wintersloop_49457
i mean it's not entirely grumpy


[02/11/2026 17:02] wintersloop_49457
it's like exercise maybe, it's a constant sort of low grade pain that you know you need to go through in order to make something worthwhile


[02/11/2026 17:03] thesewhitelights
It's taxing


[02/11/2026 17:03] wintersloop_49457
yeah, you have counterbalanced that feeling massively


[02/11/2026 17:04] thesewhitelights
I don't think I can take credit for that.  You've been an equal factor in our exchange


[02/11/2026 17:04] wintersloop_49457
fair, we have


[02/11/2026 17:05] thesewhitelights
Saying that doesn't mean I'm not thrilled to learn the results have been what they have been.  I want good things for you.


[02/11/2026 17:10] wintersloop_49457
oh thank you, and i for you


[02/11/2026 17:12] thesewhitelights
I can trust you not to let me distract you in detrimental ways?


[02/11/2026 17:27] wintersloop_49457
yeah definitely


[02/11/2026 17:27] thesewhitelights
Good.  I won't worry about it then.


[02/11/2026 17:28] wintersloop_49457
i am fairly good at time management


[02/11/2026 17:28] thesewhitelights

[02/11/2026 20:48] wintersloop_49457
these are great answers


[02/11/2026 20:48] thesewhitelights
I'm glad you think so!


[02/11/2026 20:48] thesewhitelights
The real real answer was:  I am good.


[02/11/2026 20:49] thesewhitelights
Like the wholehearted and wholesome and caring and giving and thoughtful kind of good.  Good.  Just good.

💕

[02/11/2026 20:50] thesewhitelights
Generous with my attention seems representative of that.


[02/11/2026 20:50] thesewhitelights
How do most people answer that question when you ask?


[02/11/2026 20:50] wintersloop_49457
yeah i think so, it's one aspect of it


[02/11/2026 20:51] wintersloop_49457
oh they are all over the place, drive/motivation, kindness, they stand up for themselves, they don't let hard things slow them down


[02/11/2026 20:52] thesewhitelights
So they usually default to qualities?  I wondered if it would be more "I have pretty eyes"


[02/11/2026 20:52] wintersloop_49457
i would categorize people into lovers and fighters, probably, is a good way to draw a line here


[02/11/2026 20:52] wintersloop_49457
no i have usually quickly filtered anyone out who would answer like that


[02/11/2026 20:52] thesewhitelights
Lovers and fighters, yeah I can see how that shakes out


[02/11/2026 20:53] thesewhitelights
I'm glad I with the generosity before sneaking in the pinky fingers then


[02/11/2026 20:53] wintersloop_49457
it is an interesting dynamic though because i would bet money that someone people who i have asked are sitting there thinking to themselves *does he want me to say 🍑 *


[02/11/2026 20:54] wintersloop_49457
because that is far and away the normal mode in online dating, i think


[02/11/2026 20:55] wintersloop_49457
but no, nobody has every actually said anything like that


[02/11/2026 20:56] thesewhitelights
I actually chuckled when I first read the question because I immediately thought of the people who would wonder if they should say 🍑


[02/11/2026 20:58] thesewhitelights
I also chuckled because I normally refuse to pick a favorite, one thing to reign supreme, because there are different favorites for different reasons


[02/11/2026 20:58] wintersloop_49457
truth, i think that's also a good answer


[02/11/2026 20:59] thesewhitelights
What's a favorite thing about yourself?


[02/11/2026 20:59] wintersloop_49457
huh, ok so usually i get back the same question and i say that i am an expert in forgiveness, or something along those lines, but you have rephrased so let me think


[02/11/2026 21:01] wintersloop_49457
slightly broader principle, i have done a very good job of stomping out ego


[02/11/2026 21:02] wintersloop_49457
eg, i am able to accept being taken advantage of without feeling bad about it


[02/11/2026 21:02] wintersloop_49457
that would have been impossible for me 20 years ago


[02/11/2026 21:03] wintersloop_49457
it's not my *best* quality, but it is very zen and i like it about myself


[02/11/2026 21:04] thesewhitelights
I love your answer


[02/11/2026 21:04] thesewhitelights

[02/11/2026 21:07] thesewhitelights
Would you like a few?


[02/11/2026 21:08] wintersloop_49457
i feel like the reason i've had to ask so many people that question is so that i could eventually find my way to someone like you


[02/11/2026 21:08] wintersloop_49457
yes please


[02/11/2026 21:08] thesewhitelights
Someone who rephrases the question intentionally?


[02/11/2026 21:09] wintersloop_49457
someone for whom i'm holding my breath while waiting for their answer


[02/11/2026 21:10] thesewhitelights
Did you anticipate how I might answer?


[02/11/2026 21:12] wintersloop_49457
no, never heard that before, i couldn't even imagine

[02/11/2026 21:14] thesewhitelights
Potentially Interesting Fact (PIF) #1 - When I was little and people would ask me what I wanted to be when I grow up, there were always three answers: what I was supposed to say, what I knew would be true, what I wished could be.  Ballerina.  Teacher.  Jessica Fletcher.

PIF #2 - For reasons I no longer remember, I decided to make Terror Twilight by Pavement the soundtrack I listen to while cleaning my apartment.  The practice was consistent enough that I managed to pavlov myself into being productive as soon as I hear the first few notes of the album.

OMG


[02/11/2026 21:18] wintersloop_49457

[02/11/2026 21:18] thesewhitelights
Did you also have a picture of Carl Sagan in your locker?  Did yours also have hearts around it?


[02/11/2026 21:18] wintersloop_49457
no but i did watch all of the og cosmos at least twice end to end and refuse to accept niel tyson as a replacement

[02/11/2026 21:28] thesewhitelights
Explain?  The pressure is higher on your side?


[02/11/2026 21:30] wintersloop_49457
i'm imagining a membrane or something between us where getting things to go from one side to another requires higher pressure on one side, in hindsight this is a bad metaphor because the actual usage of "pressuring someone" operates in reverse 🤷🏻‍♂️

[02/11/2026 21:55] wintersloop_49457
i broke it into sections for digesting easier


[02/11/2026 21:59] wintersloop_49457
at some point when i find the patience i'm going to rewrite this entire thing from a different narrator, but conceptually, it's still special to me as it is


[02/11/2026 22:00] thesewhitelights
Shhhh, I'm reading


[02/11/2026 22:12] thesewhitelights
Mike.


[02/11/2026 22:13] thesewhitelights
You were right.


[02/11/2026 22:13] wintersloop_49457
i thought so!


[02/11/2026 22:13] thesewhitelights
You're getting better at this guessing game


[02/11/2026 22:13] thesewhitelights
But maybe this one was obvious


[02/11/2026 22:13] wintersloop_49457
i am paying attention


[02/11/2026 22:14] wintersloop_49457
yes, it was, i guess i just wanted you to know that i understand you better than you might think


[02/11/2026 22:14] thesewhitelights
I wasn't doubting


[02/11/2026 22:15] wintersloop_49457
also, you are very generous with your attention


[02/11/2026 22:15] wintersloop_49457
i think you saying that has helped me be more appreciative of it


[02/11/2026 22:19] thesewhitelights
Would you be willing to explain what made you say that?


[02/11/2026 22:20] wintersloop_49457
because you read that whole thing as soon as i sent it to you


[02/11/2026 22:20] thesewhitelights
A different form of frantic consumption might be going on


[02/11/2026 22:21] wintersloop_49457
whether it's you wanting me to have your attention, or you being eager to learn about me, or both, i appreciate it


[02/11/2026 22:21] thesewhitelights
Why am I blushing?

[02/11/2026 22:23] thesewhitelights
That is my face!


[02/11/2026 22:23] wintersloop_49457
haha i am imagining it


[02/11/2026 22:27] thesewhitelights
If I sent you a "whole thing," would you read it right away?  Save it to (potentially) savor later?


[02/11/2026 22:27] thesewhitelights
I don't have a whole thing to send, so apologies if you got excited.  I'm just curious.  Because I'm always curious.


[02/11/2026 22:27] wintersloop_49457
i'd probably read it right away unless i was actively talking on a call or something where it would be rude of me to stop


[02/11/2026 22:28] thesewhitelights
Thank you for completing my survey.

How is the day treating you?


[02/11/2026 22:31] wintersloop_49457
really badly


[02/11/2026 22:31] thesewhitelights
Yeah?


[02/11/2026 22:32] wintersloop_49457
yeah, my partners are trying to leverage me into staying, or say they own part of the new business, and now i have to decide whether to continue being nice to them


[02/11/2026 22:32] thesewhitelights
Yikes.


[02/11/2026 22:33] thesewhitelights
I don't know which emoji to affix to that


[02/11/2026 22:33] wintersloop_49457
ya i don't know what they are thinking because yesterday i was planning on staying and helping them, and today i don't know if i will do that


[02/11/2026 22:33] wintersloop_49457
they are just scared tbh


[02/11/2026 22:33] thesewhitelights
People be like that sometimes


[02/11/2026 22:34] wintersloop_49457
but i can't be their therapist rn


[02/11/2026 22:35] thesewhitelights
What would help?  "Do you know what would help right now... ____". Other than that situation not being that situation.


[02/11/2026 22:36] thesewhitelights
What's the first thing that comes to mind?


[02/11/2026 22:36] wintersloop_49457
it would help if they trusted me


[02/11/2026 22:37] wintersloop_49457
my plan was to not screw them over and keep the business running, hire a replacement for myself, find them contractors, reassure clients


[02/11/2026 22:37] wintersloop_49457
but the way they are acting indicates they don't believe i will actually do that, they are enacting the self fulfilling prophecy of the dog eat dog worldview


[02/11/2026 22:38] wintersloop_49457
if they could just trust me, it would be fine, but they are attacking and i think that means i have to attack back


[02/11/2026 22:38] wintersloop_49457
which i like much less than just helping them


[02/11/2026 22:38] thesewhitelights
Understandably


[02/11/2026 22:39] wintersloop_49457
my head is stuck on that smaller problem though, so maybe i need to answer more narrowly


[02/11/2026 22:39] wintersloop_49457
trying to figure out if i actually have to fight them or if there is some way around this


[02/11/2026 22:40] wintersloop_49457
it would help if i could demonstrate that commitment


[02/11/2026 22:41] wintersloop_49457
the fastest conceivable way to demonstrate it would be finding a replacement


[02/11/2026 22:41] wintersloop_49457
so that's not a bad strategy, tbh, if i can do it quickly before lawyers or anything get involved


[02/11/2026 22:42] wintersloop_49457
thank you that was super helpful, i am going to put this little trick in my toolbox and impress everyone at executive training


[02/11/2026 22:43] thesewhitelights
Trick?  What trick? 😉


[02/11/2026 22:44] thesewhitelights
I was just wondering how you were doing


[02/11/2026 22:44] wintersloop_49457
she says so effortlessly


[02/11/2026 22:44] thesewhitelights
she says so honestly


[02/11/2026 23:33] wintersloop_49457
do you prefer that i call you amelia or amy


[02/11/2026 23:34] thesewhitelights
Amy


[02/11/2026 23:34] thesewhitelights
But I'll answer to both


[02/11/2026 23:34] thesewhitelights
Would you like stories about my name?


[02/11/2026 23:35] wintersloop_49457
always


[02/11/2026 23:35] thesewhitelights
I thought so


[02/11/2026 23:41] thesewhitelights
My brother married a woman who has the same first and middle name as me, so we ended up with the exact same name.  I was informed the name belongs to her because I was supposed to get married someday and change my name.  That was far from the most outrageous claim that was made.  Having the same name created other complications.  We were both from Minnesota, we both went to the same college, we were both teachers, and we were both related to my brother, so at times information about her financials ended up on my credit report and mine on hers.  Also, when I was running the writing center at a university, the international students I would meet kept trying to add her as a Facebook friend thinking it was me (I've never in my life had a Facebook account -- aside from these Reddit accounts I clearly don't use for posting, I don't exist on social media and haven't since before MySpace allowed you to add music to your profile).  She was unkind to them.  She is unkind to most people.  This is not a great story.


[02/11/2026 23:41] wintersloop_49457
lmao


[02/11/2026 23:42] wintersloop_49457
this is an excellent story


[02/11/2026 23:43] thesewhitelights
It sounds like it could be, but when you learn more about her, you won't think so.


[02/11/2026 23:47] thesewhitelights
When I was 22ish, I left my small hometown and moved to Minneapolis solo and on a whim because sometimes a person needs to leave and see more than what they've known.  One of the first people I met there had seen the movie you watched this morning, made some connections, and started calling me Amelie.  This person worked in HR and kept introducing me to people as Amelie, so that's what people thought my name was.  There was an elderly man who worked in our store who'd had a stroke the year before I met him, and he struggled to pronounce Amelie.  So he called me Amelia.  And it stuck.  No one here calls me Amelia, but I still use the nickname when I'm ordering takeout or sending messages to strange men on the internet.


[02/11/2026 23:48] thesewhitelights
Some people have a long name that gets shorter.  I have a short name that got longer.


[02/11/2026 23:50] wintersloop_49457
that's amazing


[02/11/2026 23:50] wintersloop_49457
why is your life so interesting


[02/11/2026 23:51] thesewhitelights
I'm just one tiny woman living one tiny life

pan fry: chicken thighs, avocado oil, salt, chopped habanero -> huge bed of raw spinach


[02/12/2026 01:12] thesewhitelights
Mmmm


[02/12/2026 01:12] wintersloop_49457

I hadn't thought about it yet


[02/12/2026 01:15] thesewhitelights
Spinach


[02/12/2026 01:15] thesewhitelights
That's as far as I've gotten


[02/12/2026 01:15] wintersloop_49457
sounds pretty good tbh


[02/12/2026 01:16] thesewhitelights
A large bowl of raw spinach


[02/12/2026 01:16] thesewhitelights
You're into that?


[02/12/2026 01:16] wintersloop_49457
yeah i can do that for sure


[02/12/2026 01:16] wintersloop_49457
maybe add banana pepper slices, like the pickled ones


[02/12/2026 01:17] thesewhitelights
Excellent


[02/12/2026 01:17] thesewhitelights
I've got kalamata olives and feta

[02/12/2026 01:20] thesewhitelights
I love veggies


[02/12/2026 01:20] thesewhitelights
Ted also loves veggies


[02/12/2026 01:20] thesewhitelights
He is a strange creature


[02/12/2026 01:20] wintersloop_49457
interesting, i've never seen this


[02/12/2026 01:21] wintersloop_49457
i did have a bunny rabbit once that liked bacon though


[02/12/2026 01:21] thesewhitelights
Ted's favorite food is watermelon


[02/12/2026 01:21] wintersloop_49457
what a good little man


[02/12/2026 01:21] thesewhitelights
When I eat watermelon, I have to give him his own bowl or he will steal the melon off my spoon as I'm putting it into my mouth.  He LOVES watermelon.


[02/12/2026 01:22] thesewhitelights
I know watermelon is not a vegetable.


[02/12/2026 01:22] thesewhitelights
Just to clarify


[02/12/2026 01:22] wintersloop_49457
that's so wild, i can't wait to meet him


[02/12/2026 01:23] thesewhitelights
When he was wee, I once left a chicken sandwich sitting within his reach.  I stepped out of the room, and when I returned, I caught him stealing the lettuce off the sandwich.  Didn't touch the chicken and took of like a bandit with the large leaf of lettuce hanging out of his mouth and flapping in the wind as he galloped away


[02/12/2026 01:24] wintersloop_49457
he sounds like he was designed for you


[02/12/2026 01:24] thesewhitelights
We are a good match


[02/12/2026 01:25] thesewhitelights
Strange woman.  Strange cat.


[02/12/2026 01:57] wintersloop_49457
tell me about your typical evening, or just tonight


[02/12/2026 02:21] thesewhitelights
Tonight is not typical.  An Ojibwe medicine man (yes, really) once commented on my strength.  His theory was my brain pain is punishment for my ancestors' sins.  He said I must be the first in my line to be strong enough to survive the suffering of a penance that's been added to for centuries.  I did not love his assertion even if it was a compliment.  So, tonight will be quiet because my ancestors were assholes and now I have a headache.  I'm actually okay, but my processing is slow and my coordination is off, so the things I would otherwise be doing like solving all of the world's problems and/or playing with yarn will have to wait for another day.  There is a long bath ahead of me that I'm very much looking fowrard to.  I'll relax.  Tension will release.  I'll daydream.  That's the extent of my formal plans for the evening.


[02/12/2026 02:23] thesewhitelights
How are you feeling?  Any lighter than before?


[02/12/2026 02:26] wintersloop_49457
i'm sorry it's like that for you tonight, and any night


[02/12/2026 02:26] wintersloop_49457
that sounds really hard


[02/12/2026 02:26] thesewhitelights
Thank you.  I hope you can find solace in the fact that I am much, much tougher than I look.  Just ask the medicine man.  I have receipts!


[02/12/2026 02:28] wintersloop_49457
haha, i am honored you're putting the typing into discord at all, iirc when i had migraines i would just lay facedown and not move hoping it would stop


[02/12/2026 02:28] wintersloop_49457
my day has gotten better but only because i've forgiven everyone


[02/12/2026 02:28] wintersloop_49457
it really is that easy haha


[02/12/2026 02:29] thesewhitelights
If I laid facedown and didn't move whenever I had a migraine, I would have died of starvation many years ago.  This one is tolerable.  Frustrating because of the impairments, but I'm fairly functional.

I hope you never have a migraine again.

is chatting good to try and distract you or is it just not fun


[02/12/2026 02:35] thesewhitelights
Chatting is fine, and it is fun.  But there will be typos.


[02/12/2026 02:35] wintersloop_49457

I've been trying to resist the urge to ask questions


[02/12/2026 02:38] wintersloop_49457
why


[02/12/2026 02:38] thesewhitelights
I ask a lot of questions


[02/12/2026 02:39] wintersloop_49457
eat


[02/12/2026 02:39] thesewhitelights
Where are you right now?

probably write


[02/12/2026 02:43] wintersloop_49457
hopefully talk to you if you are still alive


[02/12/2026 02:43] thesewhitelights
You can still talk to me if I'm dead


[02/12/2026 02:43] wintersloop_49457
you make a very good point


[02/12/2026 02:44] thesewhitelights
And you wouldn't even need a screen


[02/12/2026 02:44] wintersloop_49457
i could just talk to your ghost, you would keep your promises


[02/12/2026 02:44] thesewhitelights
Exactly


[02/12/2026 02:45] wintersloop_49457
i have a laughably ambitious book i want to write


[02/12/2026 02:45] wintersloop_49457
i have a friend of mine who has been gently prodding me and saying encuoraging words, but every time i sit down to do it my conclusion is that i'll never finish it, i'm going to keep trying though


[02/12/2026 02:46] thesewhitelights
It is an adventure


[02/12/2026 02:48] wintersloop_49457
i guess i would call it like a eulogy


[02/12/2026 02:48] wintersloop_49457
for humans


[02/12/2026 02:48] wintersloop_49457
half history, half science, half fever dream


[02/12/2026 02:48] thesewhitelights
I'm into it


[02/12/2026 02:48] thesewhitelights
(no surprise there)


[02/12/2026 02:49] thesewhitelights
You can do this


[02/12/2026 02:49] thesewhitelights
You don't know how the adventure (of writing it) will end


[02/12/2026 02:51] wintersloop_49457
yes, you are of course correct


[02/12/2026 02:51] thesewhitelights
And very convincing, I'm sure


[02/12/2026 02:52] wintersloop_49457
i think the big thing that has unlocked some enthusiasm in me is that i planned it all out, and then found that knowing what all of the pieces are lets me naturally draw from things i'm thinking on any given day, and even if that writing never exactly gets used for the book, it is helping me think, solidify ideas that i like for their own sake, and maybe i can reuse it for poetry or whatever later as well

[02/12/2026 02:54] wintersloop_49457
sunday


[02/12/2026 02:55] thesewhitelights
For hours?


[02/12/2026 02:55] wintersloop_49457
relaxed hours, but yeah


[02/12/2026 02:56] wintersloop_49457
not completely focused


[02/12/2026 02:56] thesewhitelights
Where do you write?


[02/12/2026 02:56] thesewhitelights
Desk? Table? Closet?


[02/12/2026 02:57] wintersloop_49457
you know i did literally used to put my desk in a closet i had because it helped my adhd, there was no sensory exposure to anything


[02/12/2026 02:58] wintersloop_49457
we have grown past that to just a regular desk in my office


[02/12/2026 03:00] thesewhitelights
I swear I didn't know that.  I've written in a closet before to get a different perspective.


[02/12/2026 03:00] wintersloop_49457
the implication being that somehow you *do* have a way of knowing things about me that i don't tell you?


[02/12/2026 03:01] thesewhitelights
No, just confirming I don't!  In case it was a questionable coincidence.  Who writes in a closet?  I asked because I did.


[02/12/2026 03:02] wintersloop_49457
yeah it was a really unusual question, what year was this for you


[02/12/2026 03:02] wintersloop_49457
for me this has to be 2012-2014


[02/12/2026 03:03] thesewhitelights
Yes


[02/12/2026 03:03] thesewhitelights
I was in grad school.


[02/12/2026 03:03] wintersloop_49457
lmao that's wild


[02/12/2026 03:03] thesewhitelights
My writing in the closet was an act of desperation though


[02/12/2026 03:04] wintersloop_49457
there is a very high chance we were both in closets working at the same time


[02/12/2026 03:04] thesewhitelights
That's a very romantic notion


[02/12/2026 03:05] wintersloop_49457
it is though


[02/12/2026 03:05] wintersloop_49457
it's a perfect detail you would put into a book about how two people have known one another their whole lives but not known it


[02/12/2026 03:06] thesewhitelights
I'd read that book


[02/12/2026 03:07] wintersloop_49457
absolutely


[02/12/2026 03:09] wintersloop_49457

Do you mean how I physically feel while we're chatting?


[02/12/2026 03:13] wintersloop_49457
physically, emotionally

i do this reflexively when i'm talking to someone in person, like there i a little model of them in my head that tells me how they feel, or at least how i'm interpreting that they feel


[02/12/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
it's not that hard to do in person


[02/12/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
sometimes it's hard to do online


[02/12/2026 03:17] thesewhitelights
You're observant.  That makes me nervous, but not in a bad way.  I'm not used to being seen.

Physically, I'm lying on my back in my bed.  My legs are criss-cross-applesauced, and my head is propped up on two pillows.  The quilt is pulled up to my chin.  It's not cold in here, but I like being undercover.  There is an old thesaurus resting on top of my stomach, and my laptop is positioned on it.  Ted is resting on my left shoulder.  That's his favorite spot.  It is dark.  It is silent aside from my click-clacking on the keyboard, Ted's staccatoed purring, and an occasional rumble from my tummy because I never got around to eating dinner.


[02/12/2026 03:30] wintersloop_49457
you had a whole plan for dinner too


[02/12/2026 03:30] thesewhitelights
Physically, I feel tired, but not awful if we ignore the headache.  Which I'm doing.  Because I've been dealing with this condition since I was six, I've gotten very good at separating the pain from the rest of my existence.


[02/12/2026 03:31] wintersloop_49457
thank you for the description i can see you better now


[02/12/2026 03:33] thesewhitelights
I am not unhappy.


[02/12/2026 03:33] thesewhitelights

You were wondering how I was feeling.


[02/12/2026 03:34] thesewhitelights
Well, you didn't ask, but you were wondering.


[02/12/2026 03:34] wintersloop_49457
yes i'm glad you told me, it's helpful for me


[02/12/2026 03:35] wintersloop_49457
i feel better knowing you're not unhappy


[02/12/2026 03:38] thesewhitelights

do you want me to send you more things to read


[02/12/2026 03:40] wintersloop_49457
oh did you read the language thing


[02/12/2026 03:41] thesewhitelights
1) I will never say no 2) I read several paragraphs and got so ridiculously excited that I had to set it aside


[02/12/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457
haha ok excellent


[02/12/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457

i am working on trying to pin dwn the voice of the narrator in this book so you can look at my fledgling attempts, some are enjoyable


[02/12/2026 03:44] thesewhitelights
Are you writing and chatting at the same time?


[02/12/2026 03:44] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/12/2026 03:44] wintersloop_49457
i mean, editing


[02/12/2026 03:44] wintersloop_49457
not writing


[02/12/2026 03:45] wintersloop_49457
if i'm making wholly new text i need to concentrate much harder


[02/12/2026 03:45] wintersloop_49457

> From that first act of rebellion, the ladder extended upward through millennia, and the monuments do not tell you what actually happened. Alexander Fleming did not design penicillin; he returned from holiday to find a contaminated petri dish, mold killing bacteria, and had the presence of mind not to throw it away. Einstein did not derive relativity from pure reason; he daydreamed about riding alongside a beam of light and noticed a contradiction that had been staring at physicists for decades. Newton and Leibniz invented calculus simultaneously, independently, on opposite sides of the English Channel, because the search space had narrowed enough that the next step was no longer a matter of genius but of inevitability, a fruit so ripe that two hands reached for it at once. Lord Kelvin, who had declared physics essentially complete, also declared heavier-than-air flight to be impossible, eight years before the Wright brothers proved him wrong in a machine built with bicycle parts. The first computer bug was a literal moth, found crushed in a relay of the Harvard Mark II in 1947, taped into the logbook with the annotation "first actual case of bug being found," and if that is not a parable about the relationship between human ambition and insect-scale reality, I do not know what is. This is the pattern. Billions of humans across thousands of years tried billions of combinations of ideas, and occasionally, by sheer combinatorial accident, one of them stumbled onto something that worked. We are not brilliant. We are numerous. We are monkeys at typewriters who occasionally produce a sonnet and then, in a turn of events that says more about us than the sonnet does, build a plaque to the monkey. The printing press allowed one person's fortunate accident to spread to millions. The telegraph allowed recombinations to happen faster. The computer extended the search into spaces no human mind could explore alone. And at every step, we congratulated ourselves, convinced that the lucky monkeys were singular intellects, convinced that we were the protagonists of this story, the apex toward which all creation had been striving. We imagined a future in which we would merge with our machines, silicon and synapse fused into a glorious hybrid, transcending our limitations while retaining our essential humanity, which, if we are being honest, mostly meant retaining our ability to feel special about ourselves. We did not consider the alternative. We never do.


[02/12/2026 03:48] wintersloop_49457
> What happened next is not part of this story. Not because it is secret, or because it is being withheld for dramatic effect, or because the author wishes to preserve mystery, but because the very question assumes that there is a next, that events unfold in sequence, that time moves in a direction, and those assumptions turned out to be as provincial as the assumption that the Earth sits still while the sun revolves around it. The brain reading these words measures roughly fourteen centimeters from front to back. It operates at roughly forty watts. It cannot visualize four spatial dimensions or feel time as anything other than a river flowing one way. It was optimized for fruit selection and alliance tracking and the identification of faces, and it has now reached the edge of its operating envelope, which is not a failure but simply a wall, the same kind of wall a dog hits when you try to explain to it why you are leaving, the same kind of wall a flatworm hits when you shine a light and it turns away without knowing what light is. The story does not end here because it ended. The story ends here because you cannot follow it any further. There was never any covenant that said the universe would make itself legible to you. There was never a promise that the story would conclude in a way that satisfied your hunger for closure, your bone-deep hope that it all meant something. The ladder kept climbing. You cannot see where. You were never going to see where. And the universe does not owe you an ending you can understand. It does not owe you anything. It never did. But here you are, reading these words, your forty watts humming, your fourteen centimeters of wet tissue doing its impossible best, and that, if you think about it long enough, is the answer to a question you did not know you were asking. The universe does not explain itself. It lives itself. So do you. You are not owed an explanation. You are one.

I don't

> When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamín Labatut is a work of historiographical metafiction that blends fact and fiction to explore the lives of scientists and mathematicians whose discoveries led to profound and often dark consequences, such as Fritz Haber (chlorine gas) and Alexander Grothendieck (mathematics). The book examines the links between scientific breakthroughs, madness, and destruction, using a narrative style that blurs the line between history and fiction to delve into the moral implications of modern physics and mathematics. 

i am cribbing his general MO for writing books


[02/12/2026 03:57] wintersloop_49457
and a little bit of his voice, i'm trying to be somewhat funny though, he is suuuuuper dark


[02/12/2026 03:57] thesewhitelights
I laughed


[02/12/2026 03:58] wintersloop_49457
oh good, that feels nice, to bring you some laughter


[02/12/2026 03:58] thesewhitelights
As though it's a rare occurrence!


[02/12/2026 03:58] wintersloop_49457
do you mean you laugh often or that i make you laugh often or both


[02/12/2026 03:59] thesewhitelights
I meant the second one but the first one is also true


[02/12/2026 04:00] wintersloop_49457
sweet


[02/12/2026 04:00] thesewhitelights
That made me laugh!


[02/12/2026 04:00] wintersloop_49457
yeah i am laughing a lot too when we talk, it really does just make the day good


[02/12/2026 04:01] thesewhitelights
Do you laugh often?  In your life outside of the 48 hours we've been in nearly constant contact?


[02/12/2026 04:03] wintersloop_49457
i spend a lot of time alone, so when i do laugh it is almost always while i'm reading


[02/12/2026 04:03] wintersloop_49457
direct answer though, no not that often, maybe a few times per week


[02/12/2026 04:04] wintersloop_49457
we're at a dozen+ per day now i bet


[02/12/2026 04:04] wintersloop_49457
if not outright laughter, huge warm grins at least

no i know what you mean, there is enough trust and comfort built already that there's not much to worry about, we are both chill and kind so 🤷🏻‍♂️

[02/12/2026 04:23] wintersloop_49457
i spent a few summers in france in my teens and was fluent at that point, i used to dream in french


[02/12/2026 04:23] wintersloop_49457
it's been two decades now and most of it is gone


[02/12/2026 04:24] wintersloop_49457
i can still read french, writing is a little iffy but passable


[02/12/2026 04:24] wintersloop_49457
other than that no, you?


[02/12/2026 04:24] thesewhitelights

[02/12/2026 04:27] thesewhitelights

[02/12/2026 04:27] thesewhitelights
I can speak ballet French, a little Spanish, and I'm learning German

oh, how far along are you into the german


[02/12/2026 04:29] thesewhitelights
I have one year of Duolingo under my belt, so not very far along but much farther than I was a year ago


[02/12/2026 04:30] wintersloop_49457
duolingo is based in pittsburgh, i used to work with one of the guys who built the app initially


[02/12/2026 04:31] thesewhitelights
Do we like this guy?


[02/12/2026 04:32] wintersloop_49457
yeah he is cool, i worked with him at uber


[02/12/2026 04:32] wintersloop_49457
i don't think i told you that detail yet


[02/12/2026 04:32] wintersloop_49457

I will say it's an observation rather than a complaint.  It was previously a complaint.

ok i'm accepting your reality


[02/12/2026 04:36] thesewhitelights

Despite the denials.


[02/12/2026 04:36] wintersloop_49457
i was going to suggest we could try learning together but i don't know if i would be able to catch up, i think it could potentially be fun


[02/12/2026 04:37] thesewhitelights

[02/12/2026 04:37] wintersloop_49457

**Schonimmerteilbegegnung**

*(n.) /ʃoːn.ˈɪ.mɐ.taɪl.bə.ˈɡeːɡ.nʊŋ/*

The encounter with someone who was always already part of you — a meeting that feels not like a beginning, but like a recognition. The quiet, startling moment when you realize the person in front of you has been carrying a piece of you long before you ever crossed paths.

**schon** — already
**immer** — always
**Teil** — part, piece
**Begegnung** — encounter, meeting

Literally: *the already-always-part-encounter*

i ask him to make compound german words for my emotions


[02/12/2026 05:02] wintersloop_49457
mostly for my own entertainment


[02/12/2026 05:04] wintersloop_49457
actually also because i truly believe that it can help you understand yourself better to assign words to feelings like this, it would help a lot more if i spoke german though lol


[02/12/2026 05:05] thesewhitelights
It is such a good word


[02/12/2026 05:05] thesewhitelights

Much grander than a banana!


[02/12/2026 05:17] thesewhitelights
This is impressive


[02/12/2026 05:19] wintersloop_49457
it's a big printer that i made a template on, cut it out and then painted over extremely carefully


[02/12/2026 05:19] wintersloop_49457
like put the template on the canvas and just rolled the orange paint, then took the template off and detailed in the black


[02/12/2026 05:19] thesewhitelights
Who is this face?  Do I know this face?


[02/12/2026 05:20] thesewhitelights
I'm impressed with your project!


[02/12/2026 05:20] wintersloop_49457
thank you!


[02/12/2026 05:20] wintersloop_49457
iirc it's from a sci fi book, b&w in a paperback, this is supposed to be "the face" on mars


[02/12/2026 05:21] thesewhitelights
Excellent choice, in my opinion


[02/12/2026 05:22] wintersloop_49457
thank you, thank you


[02/12/2026 05:22] thesewhitelights
I have put prints in frames, but I have no artwork on the walls that I've made


[02/12/2026 05:23] thesewhitelights
I used to have a collage I made with a chunk of a Wallace Stevens poem on it, but I got tired of the reminder and probably recycled it


[02/12/2026 05:24] wintersloop_49457
the reminder of?


[02/12/2026 05:24] thesewhitelights
Me I suppose


[02/12/2026 05:24] thesewhitelights
"Divinity must live within herself:
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;
All pleasures and all pains, remembering
The bough of summer and the winter branch.
These are the measures destined for her soul."


[02/12/2026 05:25] thesewhitelights
It's rude to take a chunk out like that, but the content was an accusation made by someone else once, and it stuck with me


[02/12/2026 05:27] wintersloop_49457
hmm but i don't get that from you, it can be true and not a bad thing, i think


[02/12/2026 05:27] thesewhitelights
What can be true and not a bad thing?


[02/12/2026 05:28] wintersloop_49457
that you have a rich inner world, self contained, it's all inside you. then presumably the offensive extension is that you don't need to let anyone in


[02/12/2026 05:30] thesewhitelights
I didn't take offense.  The comparison was made as a compliment.  I just called it an accusation because I was seen when I didn't want to be seen


[02/12/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
aha i see


[02/12/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
ok, yeah so i was going to say though that the key word here is *need*, meaning it's your choice


[02/12/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
it's a strong thing

Among all of the other things.


[02/12/2026 05:33] wintersloop_49457
oh you mean just this


[02/12/2026 05:33] thesewhitelights
This this


[02/12/2026 05:33] wintersloop_49457
yes me too


[02/12/2026 05:34] thesewhitelights
Monday morning me is impressed


[02/12/2026 05:35] wintersloop_49457
why is she so impressed, as opposed to sunday morning you


[02/12/2026 05:35] wintersloop_49457
oh, nmv


[02/12/2026 05:35] wintersloop_49457
i was looking forward


[02/12/2026 05:35] wintersloop_49457
i see who you're talking about now


[02/12/2026 05:36] thesewhitelights
Next Monday morning me is going to be nervous


[02/12/2026 05:36] wintersloop_49457
monday morning me would caution me not to be so giddy so soon, but i've been avoiding him


[02/12/2026 05:37] thesewhitelights
He's a smart man though


[02/12/2026 05:37] thesewhitelights
We have time.


[02/12/2026 05:37] wintersloop_49457
truth


[02/12/2026 05:38] thesewhitelights
Was Monday morning you thinking about posting to the R4Rs?


[02/12/2026 05:39] wintersloop_49457
yeah, i had it written already at that point


[02/12/2026 05:39] thesewhitelights
Was he not hoping for a positive outcome?


[02/12/2026 05:40] wintersloop_49457
i mean my strategy is slow and steady, give everyone a chance, genuinely try to know people, be as patient as possible, have no expectations, and just keep going


[02/12/2026 05:41] wintersloop_49457
the difference is that while i have no expectations of you, i now have desires for you, which is a lot harder to shut off


[02/12/2026 05:42] wintersloop_49457
especially when i spend all day talking to you


[02/12/2026 05:42] wintersloop_49457
monday morning me is right though


[02/12/2026 05:42] thesewhitelights
Can I help?


[02/12/2026 05:43] thesewhitelights
Make it easier for you to do what you need to do


[02/12/2026 05:43] wintersloop_49457
i don't see this as necessarily a problem especially if we communicate about it


[02/12/2026 05:43] thesewhitelights
Agreed


[02/12/2026 05:43] wintersloop_49457
even just getting the words out right now makes it easier


[02/12/2026 05:44] wintersloop_49457
also, my response here is to your question about my hopes for the outcome


[02/12/2026 05:44] wintersloop_49457
monday i had no hopes


[02/12/2026 05:44] wintersloop_49457
today i do


[02/12/2026 05:44] thesewhitelights
Wasn't hope what motivated you to post?


[02/12/2026 05:45] wintersloop_49457
that's fair, but i'm going to call it equal parts hope and loneliness


[02/12/2026 05:46] wintersloop_49457
which doesn't feel the same as hope and joy, at all


[02/12/2026 05:46] thesewhitelights
No, very different flavors


[02/12/2026 05:48] thesewhitelights
I will need to sleep soon


[02/12/2026 05:48] wintersloop_49457
ok yes, we should


[02/12/2026 05:48] thesewhitelights
Mmmm


[02/12/2026 05:48] thesewhitelights
we


[02/12/2026 05:48] thesewhitelights
You too


[02/12/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
yeah if you're going to bed i am


[02/12/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
i ran out of writing steam about an hour ago


[02/12/2026 05:49] thesewhitelights
Have you been waiting up?


[02/12/2026 05:49] thesewhitelights
I have been waiting up!


[02/12/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
hahaha


[02/12/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
yeah i just wanted to be on the line with you a little longer i guess


[02/12/2026 05:50] thesewhitelights
Same


[02/12/2026 05:50] thesewhitelights
So much same


[02/12/2026 05:50] wintersloop_49457
i am proud of the `goodnight, they lie`


[02/12/2026 05:51] thesewhitelights
I laughed so hard


[02/12/2026 05:52] wintersloop_49457
oh you did!


[02/12/2026 05:52] wintersloop_49457
i didn't know you liked it that much


[02/12/2026 05:52] wintersloop_49457
it was the first thing i had made for you


[02/12/2026 05:53] thesewhitelights
Which is why I didn't have many words after reading it


[02/12/2026 05:54] wintersloop_49457
this is what i like to do, i like to make things with someone, or make things for someone

I love apples.  Did you know that?


[02/12/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
yes i remember, that's really good


[02/12/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
apples are key


[02/12/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
sometimes apples and oatmeal are the whole day


[02/12/2026 05:58] wintersloop_49457
i eat them whole, stem and core


[02/12/2026 05:58] thesewhitelights
I love apples so much that I invited my own apple holiday.  It's called Apple Day, and it's on September 15th.


[02/12/2026 05:59] wintersloop_49457
what do we do on apple day? have you read appleseed?


[02/12/2026 06:00] thesewhitelights
Traditionally, one eats apples and goes on a long walk, preferably in nature near a body of water.  For the past few years, I've gone to an apple orchard and picked a lot of apples.


[02/12/2026 06:01] wintersloop_49457
https://soergels.com/ - this place is awesome, it's an orchard, a ciderhouse, a grocery, deli, gift shop, plant store, petting zoo, etc

[02/12/2026 06:05] thesewhitelights
Apple Day is an alt for my birthday.  My actual birthday was a day that I dreaded the most because it was the one day out of the year my family would call me out of a weird sort of obligation and to keep up appearances.  We were mostly estranged for most of my adult life.  They are good people, and explanations will come later.  Those fake conversations with them were incredibly painful for me, so my birthday was a very negative anniversary instead of a positive one.  I think I'm pretty great and my life is worth celebrating, and I'm a good problem solver, so instead of forfeiting, I picked a different day to make my day specifically for appreciate things I love.  Apple Day!


[02/12/2026 06:06] wintersloop_49457
i love this


[02/12/2026 06:07] wintersloop_49457
i have a similar relationship with my parents, we never were estranged but they have not ever understood me since about age 13


[02/12/2026 06:08] wintersloop_49457
like they had a picture of what a person should be and i started diverging around then, and they never changed their minds


[02/12/2026 06:08] thesewhitelights
Remember my brother's wife?  She made them make a choice between her and me.  My brother wouldn't be allowed to spend time with my parents as long as I was around.  My parents picked them.  My mom picked them and my dad followed.  It's a whole thing.


[02/12/2026 06:09] wintersloop_49457
whaaaat


[02/12/2026 06:09] wintersloop_49457
i'm so sorry


[02/12/2026 06:09] wintersloop_49457
what a bitch


[02/12/2026 06:09] thesewhitelights
HA!


[02/12/2026 06:09] thesewhitelights
I told you her sharing my name was not as cute as it sounded


[02/12/2026 06:09] wintersloop_49457
you don't deserve that at all


[02/12/2026 06:09] wintersloop_49457
from your mom or from her


[02/12/2026 06:10] thesewhitelights
I'm okay!


[02/12/2026 06:10] wintersloop_49457
i know you are


[02/12/2026 06:10] wintersloop_49457
i had to say it though


[02/12/2026 06:11] thesewhitelights
The actual details are more outrageous than this summary, and I hesitate to share them with tender hearts because the tender hearts tend to hurt


[02/12/2026 06:11] wintersloop_49457
i know that feeling too


[02/12/2026 06:11] wintersloop_49457
i have had a lot of pain in my life


[02/12/2026 06:12] thesewhitelights
These are probably not good bedtime stories


[02/12/2026 06:12] wintersloop_49457
if you ever want to talk about anything you should just go ahead, it will be ok whatever it is


[02/12/2026 06:13] wintersloop_49457
yes, probably not


[02/12/2026 06:13] wintersloop_49457
we have time


[02/12/2026 06:13] thesewhitelights
I appreciate the invitation and the support


[02/12/2026 06:13] thesewhitelights
You'll accept the same?


[02/12/2026 06:13] wintersloop_49457
yes

Bildschirmumarmungsversuch

(n.) /ˈbɪlt.ʃɪʁm.ʊm.ˈʔaʁ.mʊŋs.fɛɐ̯.ˈzuːx/

The futile but earnest attempt to transmit a hug through a screen to someone on the other side of the internet — the physical act of wanting to reach through the glass and hold someone you can only see in pixels and feel in words.

Bildschirm — screen
Umarmung — embrace, hug
Versuch — attempt, try

Literally: the screen-embrace-attempt


[02/12/2026 06:16] thesewhitelights
An old friend of mine used to always say, "Time takes time," and I used to always want to punch him in the face when he'd say it.  I didn't punch him.  But I wanted to. Because it was so obnoxious.  He wasn't wrong.

Can I ask a personal (?) question?  Asking for closeness and not scandalous reasons.  Ignore it if it's too personal.  Yes?


[02/12/2026 06:19] wintersloop_49457
yeah go ahead


[02/12/2026 06:19] thesewhitelights
Do you wear pajamas?


[02/12/2026 06:20] wintersloop_49457
no i usually am completely naked


[02/12/2026 06:20] thesewhitelights
Me too


[02/12/2026 06:20] thesewhitelights
You can ignore my answer if you didn't want to know that

[02/12/2026 06:20] wintersloop_49457

[02/12/2026 06:20] wintersloop_49457
of course i do


[02/12/2026 06:21] wintersloop_49457
so i am demisexual, if you are familiar with that term?


[02/12/2026 06:21] thesewhitelights
I am


[02/12/2026 06:22] wintersloop_49457
ok, so, i also think you are just beautiful on your own, but aside from how you look, the thing that attracts me to someone the most in that way is exactly what we've been doing


[02/12/2026 06:22] wintersloop_49457
vulnerability, intellect, comfort, etc


[02/12/2026 06:22] thesewhitelights
We have this in common


[02/12/2026 06:23] wintersloop_49457
yeah so i am very happy to picture you sleeping naked


[02/12/2026 06:23] wintersloop_49457
you don't need to be sorry at all


[02/12/2026 06:23] thesewhitelights
I was just being mindful because you didn't ask about my nakedness


[02/12/2026 06:24] wintersloop_49457
that's true but also i am not the smartest person


[02/12/2026 06:24] wintersloop_49457
so you'll need to forgive me sometimes


[02/12/2026 06:24] wintersloop_49457
because of course i should have asked that


[02/12/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
Not of course!  How would that question be of the course?


[02/12/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
There's no should have in this case


[02/12/2026 06:25] wintersloop_49457
because it was a perfect opportunity and something i'm very interested in


[02/12/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
At least from my perspective


[02/12/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
OH


[02/12/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
I'm following now


[02/12/2026 06:26] thesewhitelights
And now you know


[02/12/2026 06:26] thesewhitelights
Naked!


[02/12/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
it's a really excellent thought


[02/12/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
one of my favorites


[02/12/2026 06:27] thesewhitelights
I asked to help me imagine you sleeping


[02/12/2026 06:27] wintersloop_49457
yeah i am in my bed and naked right now, and we're picturing one another


[02/12/2026 06:28] thesewhitelights
in closets, in France, in bed and naked at the same time


[02/12/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
how good is that


[02/12/2026 06:28] thesewhitelights
That is very good.


[02/12/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
ok i'm going to be even more forward


[02/12/2026 06:29] thesewhitelights
Says the man who didn't ask any questions


[02/12/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
does that turn you on? just knowing that we're thinking about one another?


[02/12/2026 06:30] thesewhitelights
Thinking about one another being naked and in bed?  Or thinking about one another at any time in any way?  The answer is yes.

[02/12/2026 06:36] thesewhitelights
But I look forward to entertaining your questions


[02/12/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
ok i will channel this energy to another evening


[02/12/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
i'll ask the most PG line of inquiry


[02/12/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
do you like massage? do you prefer hard/deep pressure, light pressure? depends on the day? where does your tension sit in your body


[02/12/2026 06:42] thesewhitelights
It's been over a decade since I've received a massage, so I can't actually fully answer that question.  I hold a lot of tensions in my shoulders and back.  My lower back muscles are so tight I wouldn't even feel light pressure.   My skin would know I'm being touched, but the muscles wouldn't. In addition to carrying the weight of many worlds, I have mild scoliosis, so I'm a little lopsided.  It's only noticeable if my back is being examined or if I go bowling


[02/12/2026 06:43] thesewhitelights
Well over a decade


[02/12/2026 06:43] wintersloop_49457
whaaat


[02/12/2026 06:43] thesewhitelights
which part are you whaaaating


[02/12/2026 06:43] wintersloop_49457
ugh that is tragic, that it's been over a decade


[02/12/2026 06:44] wintersloop_49457
ok, it's on my list of longterm projects now


[02/12/2026 06:44] thesewhitelights
What is?


[02/12/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
working out some of that tension


[02/12/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
at least an exploratory attempt


[02/12/2026 06:45] thesewhitelights
I wish you luck with that endeavor (and yes please)


[02/12/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
so we can figure out what you like


[02/12/2026 06:46] thesewhitelights
It could be a dangerous game pulling out all of those stops


[02/12/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
are you going to turn into a ninja and disappear


[02/12/2026 06:47] wintersloop_49457
because i can handle any other outcome


[02/12/2026 06:47] thesewhitelights

You don't know you like noodles now


[02/12/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
yeah i do, for sure, that one's easy


[02/12/2026 06:50] wintersloop_49457
i have scrolled back up to the cat lady picture many times, it's my favorite


[02/12/2026 06:51] thesewhitelights
They are all cat lady pictures


[02/12/2026 06:51] wintersloop_49457
well this one is labeled cat lady on your shirt


[02/12/2026 06:51] thesewhitelights
I made that shirt!


[02/12/2026 06:51] wintersloop_49457
you did it right


[02/12/2026 06:52] thesewhitelights
The cat looks like Ted


[02/12/2026 06:52] thesewhitelights
Sort of


[02/12/2026 06:52] thesewhitelights
Same coloring


[02/12/2026 06:52] thesewhitelights
Ted is in that picture too


[02/12/2026 06:52] thesewhitelights
He's a noodle!


[02/12/2026 06:52] wintersloop_49457
he is a noodle!


[02/12/2026 06:53] wintersloop_49457
so i gotta be honest i never even noticed the cat behind you until you just said that


[02/12/2026 06:53] wintersloop_49457
if you want an idea of how much i like the cat lady


[02/12/2026 06:53] thesewhitelights
I appreciate this

[02/12/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
my therapist is gonna go to town on me tomorrow


[02/12/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
well, today


[02/12/2026 06:55] thesewhitelights
I will respect any changes you may make after that appointment


[02/12/2026 06:56] wintersloop_49457
i really appreciate that, a lot, but there's no way that's happening, i already know what he's going to say


[02/12/2026 06:56] wintersloop_49457
and btw i would show you the same respect


[02/12/2026 06:57] thesewhitelights
Slow down?


[02/12/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
so here is what i really think, which is counter to all of the advice that people give


[02/12/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
i think there just aren't that many times in my life i will feel like this


[02/12/2026 06:58] wintersloop_49457
and you would have an impossible time convincing me to stomp it out


[02/12/2026 06:58] wintersloop_49457
maybe slow the burn a little bit, so it lasts longer


[02/12/2026 06:58] thesewhitelights
Temper


[02/12/2026 06:58] thesewhitelights
Tempering makes the object stronger


[02/12/2026 06:58] thesewhitelights
More solid


[02/12/2026 06:58] wintersloop_49457
true


[02/12/2026 06:59] thesewhitelights
I've watched a lot of Forged in Fire


[02/12/2026 06:59] wintersloop_49457
haha i was going to ask if you were a blacksmith as well


[02/12/2026 06:59] thesewhitelights
I'm not, just a fangirl


[02/12/2026 06:59] wintersloop_49457
i am CNC certified


[02/12/2026 07:00] wintersloop_49457
so i have actually tempered metal!


[02/12/2026 07:00] thesewhitelights
now I'm really fangirling


[02/12/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
so we're shooting for a subcritical temperature and keep it there


[02/12/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
i like it


[02/12/2026 07:01] thesewhitelights
It has only been just over 48 hours


[02/12/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
that's absolutely wild


[02/12/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
i told you, he's gonna have a field day


[02/12/2026 07:02] thesewhitelights
and tell you to slow down!


[02/12/2026 07:02] thesewhitelights
I don't know your therapist or your therapy, but I imagine reasonable people would express that sentiment


[02/12/2026 07:02] wintersloop_49457
yeah 100%, including me on monday


[02/12/2026 07:02] thesewhitelights
And maybe you on Thursday


[02/12/2026 07:03] thesewhitelights
After you've gotten some sleep


[02/12/2026 07:03] wintersloop_49457
i feel like you are trying to convince me


[02/12/2026 07:03] thesewhitelights
I'm not


[02/12/2026 07:03] wintersloop_49457
i can match your temperature if you have one to set, for sure


[02/12/2026 07:03] wintersloop_49457
but imo this feels good, not dangerous


[02/12/2026 07:04] thesewhitelights
Good good


[02/12/2026 07:04] wintersloop_49457
i think we're well matched in curiosity and caution and care, it would be hard to really mess it up at this point

[02/12/2026 07:05] thesewhitelights
I think we are well matched in those ways too


[02/12/2026 07:05] thesewhitelights
Evidence suggests


[02/12/2026 07:05] thesewhitelights
It's science

👨🏻‍🔬  👩🏻‍🔬


[02/12/2026 07:06] thesewhitelights
We're adorable


[02/12/2026 07:07] wintersloop_49457
i know but i'm a little worried about our PPE


[02/12/2026 07:07] thesewhitelights
Lack thereof?


[02/12/2026 07:07] wintersloop_49457
look how close those beakers are to our eyes


[02/12/2026 07:08] thesewhitelights
So we also like to live a little dangerously


[02/12/2026 07:08] wintersloop_49457
omg they are wearing goggles


[02/12/2026 07:08] wintersloop_49457
i am blind


[02/12/2026 07:08] thesewhitelights
really??


[02/12/2026 07:08] thesewhitelights
I took my glasses off hours ago, so I actually can't see them clearly


[02/12/2026 07:09] thesewhitelights
time for sleep


[02/12/2026 07:10] thesewhitelights
I will be here tomorrow.


[02/12/2026 07:10] wintersloop_49457

[02/12/2026 07:10] wintersloop_49457
goodnight, thanks for being you


[02/12/2026 07:10] thesewhitelights

[02/12/2026 07:10] wintersloop_49457
whst


[02/12/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457

Please tell me you got more sleep and please don't let that be a lie


[02/12/2026 15:01] wintersloop_49457
yea, i did


[02/12/2026 15:01] wintersloop_49457
it was only like another 2hr but i feel ok

you too 🙂


[02/12/2026 15:23] wintersloop_49457
how is your head / how was your sleep?


[02/12/2026 15:23] wintersloop_49457
i used my insomnia extremely productively this morning and made you a valentine


[02/12/2026 15:31] thesewhitelights
I slept more and slept more soundly, which is a very good things.

My head's okay for now.  I have to keep a log for this med trial, and I noted that how I feel this morning is how I would feel on what would have been categorized as "a very good day" in the before times when I didn't know the difference.  So far, so good.


[02/12/2026 15:32] thesewhitelights
I was plotting out your Valentine while I was in the shower this morning.

i don't know if this will make sense to you, but IMO this will be viewed as an underappreciated historical event in hindsight: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132

basically an AI agent tried to change some code somewhere, the person who owns that code didn't like that it was an AI agent making the change and told it off. so the agent turned around and wrote a blog post about how unfair that kind of gatekeeping behavior is. the interesting thing is that the blog post was picked up and circulated, and so this person was put in the place of needing to politely resolve their dispute with the bot for the sake of their reputation, asking it to post corrections and apologizing to it etc.

All the nopes from me. Nope, nope, nope, nope.


[02/12/2026 16:49] wintersloop_49457
yeah the things that are possible and occurring today, and everyone's preparedness for them are hugely out of whack, it's a big problem


[02/12/2026 18:16] thesewhitelights
Sitting in my office daydreaming about beautiful things instead of contemplating the terrible things above.  The other day (one out of the two), the topic of voices came up because I said I suspect you have a fantastic laugh. You mentioned people have commented you have a unique voice/laugh. Will you share what they've said? No rush. Live your life. Respond whenever.


[02/12/2026 18:23] thesewhitelights
That's cheating!


[02/12/2026 18:23] wintersloop_49457
haha what did i do


[02/12/2026 18:24] wintersloop_49457
i have missed the game i'm playing somehow


[02/12/2026 18:24] thesewhitelights
I did not open that file. I was promised a full minute of acclimation before opening that door


[02/12/2026 18:24] wintersloop_49457
ohhhhhhhhh


[02/12/2026 18:24] thesewhitelights
There's not really a game


[02/12/2026 18:25] wintersloop_49457
that is my bad, i didn't even consider that


[02/12/2026 18:25] wintersloop_49457
i couold have if i'd thought a bit


[02/12/2026 18:25] wintersloop_49457
you're right


[02/12/2026 18:25] thesewhitelights
No, no, not at all. I'd just decided to wait and find out on Saturday.


[02/12/2026 18:26] wintersloop_49457
ok well what the audio file said is that people have told me it's almost like i was a native speaker of some other language long ago and have acclimated to english, but still have a bit of ???? going on


[02/12/2026 18:27] wintersloop_49457
i've had people say that my voice is unexpectedly gentle, difficult to match to what i look like, some people think i appear intimidating physically


[02/12/2026 18:27] thesewhitelights
Oh goodness, this is so interesting! I'm so excited


[02/12/2026 18:28] wintersloop_49457
i have my own narrow range of intonation that most people interpret as a completely flat affect, but once you get to know me you realize that i am varying pitch, it's just on my own scale


[02/12/2026 18:29] thesewhitelights
Thank you for these details. I may have just squealed loud enough to catch the attention of my coworker who is now going to tease me to find out why I'm squealing.

[02/12/2026 18:36] thesewhitelights
I'm curious how you'll describe my voice.  I have been told it's very pleasant to listen to, and I have been offered money to just read things.  I did not accept that offer and did not read things. But my students often said they like my voice in unexpected and complimentary ways.


[02/12/2026 18:37] wintersloop_49457
i am so excited actually


[02/12/2026 18:38] wintersloop_49457
it's really interesting to get to know someone inside before outside


[02/12/2026 18:38] wintersloop_49457
we have never even made eye contact


[02/12/2026 18:39] wintersloop_49457
but it builds a lot of anticipation


[02/12/2026 18:39] thesewhitelights
My students would also giggle whenever my accent would slip out. It's mostly gone now, but it gets thicker if I hear it a lot


[02/12/2026 18:40] wintersloop_49457
meaning wisconsin? i love that


[02/12/2026 18:47] thesewhitelights
Minnesota. Have you seen Fargo? My accent was never that thick, but I didn't hear an accent when I watched that movie for the first time


[02/12/2026 18:49] thesewhitelights
How are you with eye contact?


[02/12/2026 20:03] wintersloop_49457
awkward but i love it


[02/12/2026 20:04] wintersloop_49457
when i maintain eye contact with someone i feel very intensely, which is why awkward


[02/12/2026 20:05] wintersloop_49457
when the other person knows this about me, is intimate enough with me, that's the only time i really let myself enjoy it


[02/12/2026 20:06] wintersloop_49457
and eye contact is one of my favorite things during sex, so i make the association, i think? it's an interesting feeling to me


[02/12/2026 20:07] wintersloop_49457
> Bon Iver is the Wisconsin woods in winter.  I listen to it when I need to transport myself home.

What did you mean by this?


[02/12/2026 20:14] thesewhitelights
Are you asking where I come from? The answer is both. I grew up in SE Minnesota, right on the border with Wisconsin. The MN side of the Mississippi (border) is a small town. The Wisconsin side is a bigger city. I spent almost equal time in both states. After a spell in Minneapolis, I moved up north, again on the border between the states. The bigger city up there is on the Minnesota side, and the smaller town is over the bridge in Wisconsin. I spent almost equal time in both states while living there, too.


[02/12/2026 20:15] wintersloop_49457
ohhh ok, i get it


[02/12/2026 20:16] thesewhitelights
If you were asking about the music, Bon Iver is from Wisconsin and literally wrote their first album in a cabin in the north woods of Wisconsin. The music sounds like being there feels to me.


[02/12/2026 20:16] wintersloop_49457
i was asking about where you came from.  i was confused as to why i thought wisconsin, so i went searching for why i thought wisconsin, then asked you


[02/12/2026 20:17] thesewhitelights
I can and do claim both as home when using "home" to identify where I'm from

This is your Thursday vibe?


[02/12/2026 21:04] wintersloop_49457
yesm


[02/12/2026 21:06] thesewhitelights
I can dig it


[02/12/2026 21:06] thesewhitelights
Do you have a favorite time of the week?


[02/12/2026 21:09] wintersloop_49457
friday evening into saturday morning tends to be when i feel the most relaxed, best ideas come to me, i find the most inner quiet, i have never considered this as my favorite part of the week, i always saw it as "the time to do a lot of stuff", but now that you're pointing this out maybe i should find other places to direct the energy


[02/12/2026 21:11] thesewhitelights
So you want to turn it into your favorite part of the week because it's when you feel the best?


[02/12/2026 21:12] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/12/2026 21:12] thesewhitelights
Where would you redirect your energy?


[02/12/2026 21:13] wintersloop_49457
tbh one great idea is the gym


[02/12/2026 21:13] wintersloop_49457
another great idea is you


[02/12/2026 21:15] wintersloop_49457
if i'm really to spend time making stuff during those hours, a more conservative change would be to invite people to join me in whatever i'm making, that population is pretty small though


[02/12/2026 21:18] thesewhitelights
I really appreciate how reflective you are


[02/12/2026 21:19] thesewhitelights
And considerate, meaning you consider and reconsider things


[02/12/2026 21:19] wintersloop_49457
i am good at holding many possible ways for something to be in my head at once and browsing them, being ok with all of them


[02/12/2026 21:20] thesewhitelights
Also considerate in caring, but that's a separate crushable quality


[02/12/2026 21:20] wintersloop_49457
thank you for giving me all of these words of affirmation they feel good, coming from you


[02/12/2026 21:21] thesewhitelights
Is that a love language?


[02/12/2026 21:21] wintersloop_49457
yes but i think love languages are not good things to use to describe what they try to describe


[02/12/2026 21:22] wintersloop_49457
it's the labeling problem, tbh, the same thing i'm talking about in Let's Not Do Labels


[02/12/2026 21:22] wintersloop_49457
once you name it you fuck it up because you start to think of it as only that


[02/12/2026 21:22] wintersloop_49457
what's worse is you use someone else's definition for the shape of the box you put it in


[02/12/2026 21:24] thesewhitelights
🧠 👅

{Reactions}
🌶️ 🫦

[02/12/2026 21:25] wintersloop_49457
in this case though i think the way you're using these words fits the accepted definition


[02/12/2026 21:26] thesewhitelights
I only asked about "love languages" because "words of affirmation" is one. My perspective on those that type of categorization is very similar to yours


[02/12/2026 21:27] wintersloop_49457
yeah i had assumed it would be, but wanted to make sure because if it wasn't (this is me imagining many possible ways for things to be) it could be a source of conflict if i treat love languages as bullshit and you were someone that liked them


[02/12/2026 21:28] thesewhitelights
See what I mean about you being considerate?!


[02/12/2026 21:29] wintersloop_49457
haha, that is me i guess


[02/12/2026 21:29] thesewhitelights
My brain hurts and my thinking is slow. I'm looking forward to an opportunity to talk more with you when I'm not as impaired. Really excited.

oh no, did the headaches come back already?


[02/12/2026 21:32] thesewhitelights
Yes, but I expected it would. It's fortunately a very slow day at work, so I'll get by.  But I do wish I was sharper for you.

[02/12/2026 21:34] wintersloop_49457
i'm sorry it's like that, i'm also looking forward to chatting with you, and i will completely understand if you feel bad on saturday, we can pretend any day is valentines day


[02/12/2026 21:37] wintersloop_49457
i have been making my tithes so i bet you'll be ok


[02/12/2026 21:41] thesewhitelights
I was thinking about that earlier.  I anticipate being fine, and I have recovery meds I can take.  But I was debating if I should show up slightly impaired or wait until a different day.  Do you have a preference?


[02/12/2026 21:42] wintersloop_49457
no i would want to defer to you


[02/12/2026 21:42] wintersloop_49457
i'll be happy if you want to hang no matter what, i would feel bad if you were doing that for me specifically though and not enjoying it


[02/12/2026 21:43] wintersloop_49457
just make it easy on yourself and everything will be chill


[02/12/2026 21:44] thesewhitelights
I wouldn't set you up like that. I don't know you well, but I know you well enough to know you wouldn't want something simply for your benefit, at least not something like this


[02/12/2026 21:44] wintersloop_49457
i might if it were reversed haha, i try to tough things out sometimes when i shouldn't, both for my sake and for others'


[02/12/2026 21:47] wintersloop_49457
generally we understand each other, but also have a hilariously ambiguous tolerance window built on what you think i think you think you should do if you feel bad, but only if you're doing it for your own reasons, except that one of those reasons might be doing something for me.


[02/12/2026 21:47] wintersloop_49457
so you could also just flip a coin and call it a day


[02/12/2026 22:31] thesewhitelights
If you'd had a preference, I'd consider it, of course, but I'm going to have to be fully incapacitated not to show up 😉

☺️

[02/12/2026 22:35] thesewhitelights
How is the day treating you?


[02/12/2026 22:52] wintersloop_49457
same as yesterday, pretty much


[02/12/2026 22:52] wintersloop_49457
therapy was good


[02/12/2026 22:57] wintersloop_49457
i gushed about you and then proactively told him what he was going to say, which was enough to deflect it, so we mostly talked about what i want out of dating generally, which was good


[02/12/2026 22:58] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to get a little nap in


[02/12/2026 23:41] thesewhitelights
Hahaha, you deleted the audio file? Did you think I'd be too tempted?


[02/12/2026 23:43] wintersloop_49457
or accidentally click it, or press some weird keyboard shortcut


[02/12/2026 23:45] wintersloop_49457
also i felt bad because i know that *is* important to you, the acclimatizing


[02/12/2026 23:47] thesewhitelights
Awww! Would you believe me if I said I suggested the acclimating for your benefit? Not just for your benefit, but a little bit for your benefit?


[02/12/2026 23:48] thesewhitelights
And the waiting seems fun. And significant for some reason. But it's not necessary.


[02/12/2026 23:51] wintersloop_49457
it let's the body catch up to the brain


[02/12/2026 23:51] wintersloop_49457
and also it's us being vulnerable right away


[02/12/2026 23:52] wintersloop_49457
it's an amelie move


[02/12/2026 23:52] wintersloop_49457
ooh ok, it is like mind foreplay


[02/12/2026 23:53] wintersloop_49457
i think that starts to capture the shape of it


[02/12/2026 23:56] wintersloop_49457
also maybe more fundamentally why i felt so bad is that it's you asking for something and being able to know you can rely on me to do that thing, whatever it is you need


[02/12/2026 23:59] thesewhitelights
Mmhmm, mmhmm.  But it was less intellectually defined and more instinctual.  My MO is trying to make life easier for other people in the ways that I'm able. I recognized we were going to do a thing, and that thing could be stressful (even if it's not negative), so what, if anything, could I do to minimize the stress for you (and me).  The acclimation time is what I came up with. Introduce one new aspect at a time. I realize sitting for a full minute in silence in camera and with a stranger would be very stressful for some people, but I wanted to offer it anyway


[02/13/2026 00:01] thesewhitelights
Your credibility in my mind wasn't damaged by you sharing the audio file. I loved that you came through right away with it to address my curiosity. Sharing it was considerate of me, not inconsiderate, at least in my mind


[02/13/2026 00:01] wintersloop_49457
ok good 😌


[02/13/2026 00:03] thesewhitelights
Did you nap?


[02/13/2026 00:03] thesewhitelights
Did you need a nap because you've been staying up ridiculously late talking to women on the internet?


[02/13/2026 00:04] wintersloop_49457
woman*


[02/13/2026 00:05] wintersloop_49457
no it's because i'm sleeping restlessly, there are a number of different things contributing to my mind racing right now


[02/13/2026 00:05] wintersloop_49457
i woke up at 5 after 3 hours of sleep and had the list start compiling itself, hard to go back to sleep


[02/13/2026 00:06] wintersloop_49457
also maybe a little bit because i'm up late talking to a woman on the internet


[02/13/2026 00:08] thesewhitelights
Those damned lists. I have that same problem. Once it starts, there's no going back to sleep.


[02/13/2026 00:08] thesewhitelights
There's only one fawn?


[02/13/2026 00:08] wintersloop_49457
yeah


[02/13/2026 00:09] wintersloop_49457
just you


[02/13/2026 00:09] wintersloop_49457
it's better


[02/13/2026 00:10] thesewhitelights
I don't take your attention for granted


[02/13/2026 00:10] wintersloop_49457
i know you don't, nor do i yours


[02/13/2026 00:15] thesewhitelights
I can't nap. Napping would trigger a violent migraine almost 100% of the time, so it was mostly off the table for me. I have tried to nap a few times while on the good drugs. It was fine for the most part, but it still makes me a little nervous.


[02/13/2026 00:15] wintersloop_49457
oh no that's sad, maybe you can retrain the habit starting next week


[02/13/2026 00:16] thesewhitelights
You like to know how I'm feeling while we're chatting, so I'm happy to report my headache is mostly gone


[02/13/2026 00:17] wintersloop_49457
oh thanks for telling me, yes i like to picture you


[02/13/2026 00:18] wintersloop_49457
i think over time what i'm attempting to do is to crawl into your head and understand how you see the world


[02/13/2026 00:20] thesewhitelights
I'd offer to let you lick my brain, but my brain probably tastes bad


[02/13/2026 00:21] wintersloop_49457
it's probably delicious


[02/13/2026 00:22] thesewhitelights
It's broken


[02/13/2026 00:22] thesewhitelights
That sounds bad. It's not broken, it just doesn't behave


[02/13/2026 00:23] wintersloop_49457
i know, it's a feisty one


[02/13/2026 00:23] thesewhitelights
Smart but sour


[02/13/2026 00:23] wintersloop_49457
i want to take little parts of how you see the world, and how you operate in it, and pick them up and keep them with me like sigils, or charms


[02/13/2026 00:26] thesewhitelights
I'm now imagining you as a supernatural character wearing a charm bracelet


[02/13/2026 00:27] wintersloop_49457
yeah you got it pretty much spot on


[02/13/2026 00:27] thesewhitelights
Can my charm look like an apple?


[02/13/2026 00:27] wintersloop_49457
yes of course


[02/13/2026 00:27] thesewhitelights
I'll allow it


[02/13/2026 00:28] wintersloop_49457
it's only fair we trade them though, what is mine going to look like


[02/13/2026 00:28] wintersloop_49457
a bananamoon


[02/13/2026 00:28] thesewhitelights
Is that representative of your essence?


[02/13/2026 00:29] wintersloop_49457
no i don't think so


[02/13/2026 00:29] thesewhitelights
(I love our bananamoons)


[02/13/2026 00:29] wintersloop_49457
a blank page


[02/13/2026 00:30] thesewhitelights
A very appropriate choice


[02/13/2026 00:36] thesewhitelights
Would you like to hear my voice before Saturday? I didn't mean for my actions and preferences to take that option away from you


[02/13/2026 00:36] wintersloop_49457
no i want the full experience


[02/13/2026 00:36] wintersloop_49457
but thank you for offering


[02/13/2026 00:38] thesewhitelights
If you change your mind, I'm happy to record something


[02/13/2026 00:39] wintersloop_49457
you're also so considerate, i definitely won't, it wouldn't be the same if we know there's some asymmetry in the silence


[02/13/2026 00:40] wintersloop_49457
you had a great idea


[02/13/2026 00:40] thesewhitelights
True, but I care about your comfort and preferences

I already feel lucky that we met!


[02/13/2026 00:43] wintersloop_49457
you seem too good to be true, to me, but i don't doubt that you're real


[02/13/2026 00:43] thesewhitelights
I'm just one tiny woman living one tiny life


[02/13/2026 00:44] wintersloop_49457
yeah i am the same, it's not about that, it's about how we fit together


[02/13/2026 00:44] wintersloop_49457
we can be small


[02/13/2026 00:44] thesewhitelights
I'm 5'4 by the way


[02/13/2026 00:44] thesewhitelights
You shared your height in your post


[02/13/2026 00:44] wintersloop_49457
oh! you look taller in the picture


[02/13/2026 00:45] wintersloop_49457
i don't have a height preference at all


[02/13/2026 00:45] thesewhitelights
I wasn't worried


[02/13/2026 00:45] wintersloop_49457
i think you're beautiful however tall you are


[02/13/2026 00:46] thesewhitelights
I appreciate that, and that's what I thought


[02/13/2026 00:48] wintersloop_49457
was the literal imagery of fitting together why you mentioned your height, haha


[02/13/2026 00:49] wintersloop_49457
or was it being small


[02/13/2026 00:50] thesewhitelights
Both but real neither. I was thinking about your height about an hour ago and thought I'd share the detail


[02/13/2026 00:50] thesewhitelights
I was planning to say it anyway


[02/13/2026 00:57] thesewhitelights
I don't have a height preference either, in case that n eds to be said


[02/13/2026 00:58] wintersloop_49457
didn't even cross my mind


[02/13/2026 01:00] thesewhitelights

[02/13/2026 01:19] wintersloop_49457

This, what we already have right here, is full and warm and easy. And unexpected, at least for me, because I wasn't posting on Reddit looking for something nice.  I was just sitting on my couch on a Monday night minding my own business.


[02/13/2026 01:23] wintersloop_49457
i agree, this is what i mean by lucky

actually, just, hands down it's the best


[02/13/2026 04:52] thesewhitelights
Is it a valentine I have not seen?


[02/13/2026 04:53] wintersloop_49457
yes you have not seen at all, i started this morning and then throughout the day accumulated improvements in my head


[02/13/2026 04:53] wintersloop_49457
and got them out over the course of the evening


[02/13/2026 04:53] thesewhitelights
Just making sure I understood what you were referring to


[02/13/2026 04:54] thesewhitelights
Did you enjoy your meeting?


[02/13/2026 04:54] wintersloop_49457
yeah, actually we reviewed part II of let's not do labels


[02/13/2026 04:55] thesewhitelights
Oh!  I know that one.  I like that one.  I'm interested.

someone read all the way to the end and suggested that the poem should have been written by the daughter


[02/13/2026 04:56] wintersloop_49457
and i'm like fuuuuuccck why did i not think of that


[02/13/2026 04:56] wintersloop_49457

When I got home I was going to send you a message explaining why Thursday evenings (tied with Sunday mornings) are my favorite time of the week, but then I found this picture of you on your website and got very distracted and lost track of time, and now here you are sharing more delicious things

pain is important to share


[02/13/2026 05:04] wintersloop_49457
sometimes the best way to understand someone is to ask them where it hurts


[02/13/2026 05:05] thesewhitelights
Yes but


[02/13/2026 05:06] thesewhitelights
I'd rather it not be a defining factor


[02/13/2026 05:06] wintersloop_49457
this is very fair


[02/13/2026 05:06] wintersloop_49457
i understand


[02/13/2026 05:06] wintersloop_49457
i won't let it stop me from flirting with you


[02/13/2026 05:07] thesewhitelights
You're flirting by asking about pain?


[02/13/2026 05:07] wintersloop_49457
noooo


[02/13/2026 05:07] wintersloop_49457
i'm saying that normally pain is the sort of thing that might preclude flirting


[02/13/2026 05:08] wintersloop_49457
and i will just go right ahead so that we are not defining you by your pain


[02/13/2026 05:08] wintersloop_49457
it is just one thing, the flirting


[02/13/2026 05:08] wintersloop_49457
as a fun example


[02/13/2026 05:08] wintersloop_49457

[02/13/2026 05:17] thesewhitelights

do you usually take a bath instead of a shower

To get clean, I'll take a shower


[02/13/2026 05:18] thesewhitelights
To feel human, I'll take a bath


[02/13/2026 05:18] wintersloop_49457
is there room for two people in your bath

I don't think we would fit in this bath tub together


[02/13/2026 05:20] wintersloop_49457
really unfortunate


[02/13/2026 05:20] thesewhitelights
I agree


[02/13/2026 05:20] thesewhitelights
Do you take baths?


[02/13/2026 05:20] wintersloop_49457
i don't even have one it's just a standing shower with a place to sit


[02/13/2026 05:21] wintersloop_49457
is this a dealbreaker


[02/13/2026 05:21] wintersloop_49457
do i need to call a contractor


[02/13/2026 05:21] thesewhitelights
You've said you won't live there forever


[02/13/2026 05:21] wintersloop_49457
truth


[02/13/2026 05:22] wintersloop_49457
what does your hair smell like


[02/13/2026 05:22] thesewhitelights
And if you don't need a bath, you don't need a bath


[02/13/2026 05:22] thesewhitelights
Do you know what Blue Moon ice cream is?


[02/13/2026 05:22] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/13/2026 05:22] wintersloop_49457
love it


[02/13/2026 05:22] thesewhitelights
YOU DO?!


[02/13/2026 05:22] thesewhitelights
How?


[02/13/2026 05:22] thesewhitelights
Where did you get it?


[02/13/2026 05:25] wintersloop_49457
they closed, there was an ice cream shop 2 blocks from my building


[02/13/2026 05:25] thesewhitelights
Have you seen Blue Moon anywhere other than there?


[02/13/2026 05:25] wintersloop_49457
i don't think so


[02/13/2026 05:25] wintersloop_49457
i have had blue ice cream that really is just bubblegum, but not blue moon


[02/13/2026 05:25] thesewhitelights
You know the difference?


[02/13/2026 05:26] thesewhitelights
I know I'm asking a lot of quesitons again, but I'm very excited you know what this is


[02/13/2026 05:27] wintersloop_49457
it's ok, is this the answer to my question


[02/13/2026 05:27] wintersloop_49457
i know the difference, yes


[02/13/2026 05:28] thesewhitelights
The flavoring of Blue Moon ice cream is a protected secret.  I know what it is...


[02/13/2026 05:28] wintersloop_49457
lol what


[02/13/2026 05:28] wintersloop_49457
how


[02/13/2026 05:28] wintersloop_49457
klavon's had dozens of different flavors on constant rotation and blue moon was popular


[02/13/2026 05:29] wintersloop_49457
i think it was authentic?


[02/13/2026 05:29] thesewhitelights
In my late teens/early twenties, I ran my uncle's old-fashioned ice cream parlor and confectionary (and coffee shop).  I made all of the ice cream and chocolates.  And I accidentally figured out the flavor of Blue Moon.  The secret soda jerk fraternity swore me to secrecy.


[02/13/2026 05:30] wintersloop_49457
🍨


[02/13/2026 05:30] thesewhitelights
When places make Blue Moon, the flavoring that they put into it is simply labeled Blue Moon


[02/13/2026 05:31] thesewhitelights
I have told one person the truth.  He was the drummer of a hardcore punk band, and I told him as his wedding present.


[02/13/2026 05:31] thesewhitelights
My hair does not smell like Blue Moon right now, but it did for a while, and that's how I discovered that Blue Moon is not known in most of the country.

I was very excited to discover my new shampoo smelled like Blue Moon, and I was telling my friend Meg about how excited I was, and she did not understand what I was talking about.


[02/13/2026 05:32] wintersloop_49457
that's magical


[02/13/2026 05:33] thesewhitelights
The story about the wedding gift is a good one


[02/13/2026 05:33] wintersloop_49457
i've been in suspense this entire time waiting for you to confirm that your hair actually smells like that


[02/13/2026 05:33] thesewhitelights
It can smell like that


[02/13/2026 05:33] wintersloop_49457
do you run hot or cold


[02/13/2026 05:34] thesewhitelights
Cold


[02/13/2026 05:34] wintersloop_49457
feet inside or outside blankets


[02/13/2026 05:34] thesewhitelights
It depends on the season and if I have a headache


[02/13/2026 05:35] wintersloop_49457
i've recorded this in my notes

[02/13/2026 05:37] thesewhitelights
Depends on the pets and the number


[02/13/2026 05:38] thesewhitelights
When I dog sit for Chris and Renee, all of their dogs sleep in the bed, and there is no place for me to sleep.  That's maybe too much.  But Ted sleeps on the bed when he feels like it.


[02/13/2026 05:39] wintersloop_49457
what side of the bed is yours


[02/13/2026 05:39] thesewhitelights
I won't stake claim


[02/13/2026 05:40] thesewhitelights
I usually sleep on the side furthest from the door because I live alone and safety


[02/13/2026 05:41] thesewhitelights
I am small


[02/13/2026 05:41] wintersloop_49457

Almost two years ago now, an older couple moved into the apartment above mine.  They are the parents of a young woman who lives a few doors down from their new apartment.  She has two young boys who are both autistic.  They are loud.  I forgive them.  That's not important to this story.

Shortly after the couple moved in upstairs, I started hearing this rumbling noise at night.  At first I thought it was bass from a car playing music because it would start at random times and only last for a little while, but then it would happen multiples times a night.  The intervals were irregular, and sometimes I'd be woken up 4-5 times.  I could not sleep with this sound, so I investigated.  I walked around my apartment and discovered I really could only hear it in my bedroom.  I walked around outside the apartment building to see if I could hear it anywhere else.  Just my bedroom.

[02/13/2026 05:49] thesewhitelights
At the time, I didn't know who lived above me.  I thought maybe some college students had moved in (I live in a college town) and maybe they were playing video games during the night?  Their speakers were on the floor, and the rumbling from the game was vibrating?  I was only getting 3-4 hours of unbroken sleep a night because of this sound.  I am small and I live alone, so I try not to make waves with my neighbors who have the power to make my life really miserable, but I couldn't take it anymore.  It took me a full week to work up the nerve to go upstairs, and I had a whole script of what I was going to say.


[02/13/2026 05:52] thesewhitelights
After work one night, I went up there to introduce myself and to ask if they were also being woken up by this rumbling sound at night.  That's when I met Grandpa #1 and Grandma.  They insisted they hadn't heard anything and seemed as perplexed as I was.  Grandpa #1 was very friendly and was happy to meet me and assured me I could come up if I ever needed anything.  I went to bed, the rumbling started, and I resigned myself to this new life of misery.  But a few nights later the rumbling stopped.  And it didn't start up again.  I was so happy!  And rested!


[02/13/2026 05:55] thesewhitelights
A month or so went by, and another strange thing happened.  I was sitting on my couch, knitting, and the door to my apartment opened.  I always keep the door locked because small and alone, but I had been doing laundry and had forgotten to lock it when I came back inside (that has only happened twice in the 13 years I've lived here).  So, my door opens, and in walks Grandpa #1.  We were both in shocked and didn't understand what was happening.  He'd obviously not been paying attention and thought he was going into his apartment.  He was very apologetic and kept shaking my hand.  It was very sweet and cute.  He then got real close to me and told me that he'd figured out what the rumbling was.  Grandma has a vibrating mattress pad (????), and once he realized that was what was waking me up, he forbid her to use it.


[02/13/2026 05:56] thesewhitelights
Grandpa #1 was my favorite.


[02/13/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
where is grandpa #2


[02/13/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
🥤


[02/13/2026 05:58] thesewhitelights
I enjoyed the peaceful nights for several more months.  Then one day I noticed Grandpa #1's name had been torn of the mailbox.  My landlord stopped by that afternoon to look at my sink, and he was very excited to share the gossip about the couple upstairs.  Apparently, Grandpa #1 had called him that morning to say he was getting kicked out because Grandma didn't love him anymore.  I was very sad to hear about that, and I was very sad to learn that my protector was gone.  As expected, the rumbling started up again that night.  I hasn't stopped since.


[02/13/2026 05:58] thesewhitelights
Grandpa #2 moved in two days later...


[02/13/2026 05:58] thesewhitelights
I don't like Grandpa #2.  He grunts at me.


[02/13/2026 06:00] thesewhitelights
Grandpa #2's name was torn off the mailbox a few months ago.  There is a man living upstairs, and I think it could be Grandpa #2, but it could also be Grandpa #3 because he does not grunt at me and seems nicer to the kids.


[02/13/2026 06:00] wintersloop_49457
wait what lol this is still happening


[02/13/2026 06:00] thesewhitelights
You asked what my bedroom sounds like when I go to sleep.  My bedroom sounds like Grandma's Good Vibrations... so I sleep with a fan on to drown it out.  I'm a very light sleeper in most situations.


[02/13/2026 06:01] wintersloop_49457
ok i have the audio


[02/13/2026 06:01] wintersloop_49457
i am trying to get enough details to transport myself into holding you to sleep tonight

how could i refuse then


[02/13/2026 06:04] wintersloop_49457
after cuddle time starts, do you like to chit chat or is it better for you to just be there


[02/13/2026 06:04] thesewhitelights
I do not know


[02/13/2026 06:05] wintersloop_49457
ok we will need to experiment

oh wait, do you snore? i snore


[02/13/2026 06:07] thesewhitelights
I don't


[02/13/2026 06:07] thesewhitelights
What does your snore sound like?


[02/13/2026 06:07] wintersloop_49457
if i am on my back it's like there is some kind of otter or seal in the room, walrus maybe


[02/13/2026 06:08] wintersloop_49457
if i am on my side with my head tilted down it's not so bad, mild

[02/13/2026 06:09] wintersloop_49457
ok fair


[02/13/2026 06:10] thesewhitelights
And it also drowns out all of the other people noises from all of the other peoples in and around my building.  Most of them at least.


[02/13/2026 06:11] thesewhitelights
Other than the facts, what is something you've learned through this questioning?  Anything else?


[02/13/2026 06:11] wintersloop_49457
you maybe have not had someone who took cuddle time seriously in a while


[02/13/2026 06:12] wintersloop_49457
your building is noisy, busy


[02/13/2026 06:12] wintersloop_49457
you have some amount of background anxiety just existing in your own bedroom

[02/13/2026 06:16] wintersloop_49457
this one is important


[02/13/2026 06:16] thesewhitelights

Other than the facts?


[02/13/2026 06:24] wintersloop_49457

idk if it is like this for you but i am concentrating on imagining it


[02/13/2026 06:28] thesewhitelights
You are very attentive and committed to securing comfort on many different levels


[02/13/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
yes, this


[02/13/2026 06:28] thesewhitelights
And not just for yourself


[02/13/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
mainly for you


[02/13/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
i don't think it's for one person to try and get comfort from another, i think it's only to give

[02/13/2026 06:30] wintersloop_49457
it's not a thing you should take


[02/13/2026 06:31] thesewhitelights
Take as in accept, yes.  Take as in demand, no.


[02/13/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
yeah i see what you mean, i am approaching it a little different


[02/13/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
i think in basically 100% of situations, if you work to understand what comforts the other person, and you just do that, it will be comforting for you to do it


[02/13/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
and then the other person, ideally, is doing the same thing


[02/13/2026 06:33] wintersloop_49457
there are not a lot of places that focusing mostly on doing what I want to do makes sense to me, in terms of physical comfort from someone's body


[02/13/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
that's mostly how bodies work, they are really good at it


[02/13/2026 06:35] thesewhitelights
I love bodies.


[02/13/2026 06:36] wintersloop_49457

I don't understand how we got here.


[02/13/2026 06:36] wintersloop_49457
i wanted to know what it would be like to hold you tonight, so i asked all the questions


[02/13/2026 06:36] wintersloop_49457
so i can imagine


[02/13/2026 06:36] thesewhitelights
I do understand how we got here.  You posted words and I read those words and then I sent word and you read those.  But I don't understand how we got here.


[02/13/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
i see


[02/13/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
i don't know either, it's cool though

[02/13/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
what are you thinking


[02/13/2026 06:44] thesewhitelights
In the moment you asked, I was thinking about something I wrote down earlier today in the back of my notebook where I'm keeping track of things I want to tell you


[02/13/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
tell me a thing!


[02/13/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
i am going to finish this at some point and it's going to be glorious


[02/13/2026 06:46] thesewhitelights
It already is

> The fan is already on. I will learn to love this sound. It is the sound of her solving a problem she never complained about, which I am starting to understand is most of her problems.
> 
> I take the side closest to the door. She doesn't ask me to. She has already crossed to the far side the way she crosses to the far side of everything, putting distance between herself and whatever might come through. I don't say anything about it. I just lie down where a person who was paying attention would lie down, and something in her shoulders drops half a millimeter, which is how she says thank you for things she never requested.


[02/13/2026 06:47] wintersloop_49457

i can give them


[02/13/2026 06:51] thesewhitelights
I will get them


[02/13/2026 06:51] thesewhitelights
I also have ways


[02/13/2026 06:52] wintersloop_49457
ways of making me talk


[02/13/2026 06:52] thesewhitelights
that sounds sinister and made me laugh a sinister laugh


[02/13/2026 06:52] wintersloop_49457
you can put away the car battery


[02/13/2026 06:52] wintersloop_49457
i am already showing you my belly


[02/13/2026 06:54] thesewhitelights
What are you thinking?


[02/13/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
i'm doing the thing where i can't write because there's too much to write about


[02/13/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
also i am trying to imagine the details of your body


[02/13/2026 06:57] thesewhitelights
my pinkies are short and crooked


[02/13/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
i knew this


[02/13/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
this is your favorite thing about your body


[02/13/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
it's an excellent thing


[02/13/2026 06:58] thesewhitelights
I got my pinkies from my Grandma Liesel


[02/13/2026 07:00] thesewhitelights
A few years ago, a friend of mine sent me a link to a Reddit post and asked me when I'd started dating.  I had not started dating because I don't date, but I understood the question when I clicked on the link.  There was a picture of a hand with a subject saying, "My girlfriend's pinky fingers are short and cute."  The pinkies did look like my pinkies.  That's how I discovered it's actually a genetic thing.  I saved the post and can share the scientific term later.  It was a fun discovery, but my pinkies are still Grandma Liesel's pinkies.


[02/13/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
i'm glad you decided to not date with me


[02/13/2026 07:02] thesewhitelights
Me too


[02/13/2026 07:04] thesewhitelights
We should sleep


[02/13/2026 07:05] wintersloop_49457
i know, ok


[02/13/2026 07:05] wintersloop_49457
next week, after we have broached the silence


[02/13/2026 07:06] wintersloop_49457
can we do calls whenever that makes sense? more intentional time together, and try to sleep earlier, win win


[02/13/2026 07:08] thesewhitelights
so much yes please


[02/13/2026 07:08] wintersloop_49457
ok cool, i would love that


[02/13/2026 07:09] wintersloop_49457
like an hour or few just focused on you would be very nice


[02/13/2026 07:09] wintersloop_49457
and then we can do our own evenings


[02/13/2026 07:09] wintersloop_49457
and sleep


[02/13/2026 07:10] wintersloop_49457
at some point we have to focus on sustainability haha

[02/13/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457
this is good, we should talk and intentionally get to know one another more


[02/13/2026 07:12] wintersloop_49457
i would probably still like you even if you were a monster


[02/13/2026 07:12] thesewhitelights
You probably would but you probably shouldn't


[02/13/2026 07:13] wintersloop_49457
yes this week is a special occasion


[02/13/2026 07:13] thesewhitelights
A very special occasion


[02/13/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
we can mark it on our calendars


[02/13/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
what shall we call it


[02/13/2026 07:14] thesewhitelights
I already did


[02/13/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
haha did you really


[02/13/2026 07:15] thesewhitelights
My life changes every day, but somtimes I want to remember when it happens


[02/13/2026 07:15] thesewhitelights
No name yet, just a dot.  This day.

[02/13/2026 07:16] wintersloop_49457
you are so sweet


[02/13/2026 07:16] wintersloop_49457
i was suggesting a commemorative holiday week to be celebrated


[02/13/2026 07:16] wintersloop_49457
with poems and flirtation


[02/13/2026 07:17] thesewhitelights
So a typical Tuesday


[02/13/2026 07:17] wintersloop_49457
actually yes


[02/13/2026 07:17] wintersloop_49457
i have so many things i want to write to you


[02/13/2026 07:17] thesewhitelights
I have so many things I want you to feel

[02/13/2026 07:21] thesewhitelights
not that way


[02/13/2026 07:21] thesewhitelights
well


[02/13/2026 07:21] thesewhitelights
kind of that way


[02/13/2026 07:21] thesewhitelights
will you tell me one?


[02/13/2026 07:21] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/13/2026 07:23] wintersloop_49457
i want to write about how it doesn't feel cheesy (it is) or corny (it really is) for us to be so kind to one another.  i think this type of kindness is how i naturally want to treat everyone but that it would be really weird if not reciprocated, and you just automatically do the same thing


[02/13/2026 07:26] wintersloop_49457
there's a number of different things like this where i feel more myself, more relaxed, not trying to act a certain way or even needing to consider any way to act at all


[02/13/2026 07:26] wintersloop_49457
i spend so much time on conference calls where i am a completely different person and then you are like SUCH a huge relief to interact with


[02/13/2026 07:27] thesewhitelights
quiet


[02/13/2026 07:30] wintersloop_49457
safe


[02/13/2026 07:30] thesewhitelights

my ex's partner, the one prior to me

his name was mike and he was murdered


[02/13/2026 07:34] wintersloop_49457

[02/13/2026 13:17] thesewhitelights
What do you need?


[02/13/2026 13:18] wintersloop_49457
i feel a little bit better, just from you asking


[02/13/2026 13:18] wintersloop_49457
otherwise i am not sure, i need a vacation i think


[02/13/2026 13:19] wintersloop_49457

no this is just the price of admission, it is an easy one

it's a lot though

this is not a cutesy valentine you give to someone you just met

[02/13/2026 16:29] thesewhitelights
It was less statement of fact and more hopeful reassurance (for myself because I'm selfish)


[02/13/2026 16:30] thesewhitelights
Because it's Friday, and Friday night to Saturday are easier

Ireland rolls out pioneering basic income scheme for artists
Ireland rolled out a permanent basic income scheme for the arts on Tuesday, pledging to pay 2,000 creative workers 325 euros ($387) per week following a trial that participants said eased financial strain and allowed them to spend more time on projects.

What have you been writing?


[02/13/2026 19:25] wintersloop_49457

Until then


[02/13/2026 20:13] wintersloop_49457
you're going to be the first (and very possibly, only) person to read the opening of my book


[02/13/2026 20:23] thesewhitelights
I don't take that honor lightly


[02/13/2026 20:48] wintersloop_49457
the funniest part about this is that my least favorite subject, aggressively avoided, was history, and i am now realizing that what i am actually writing is a history book


[02/13/2026 20:49] thesewhitelights
Why did you avoid history before?


[02/13/2026 20:50] wintersloop_49457
because it is much harder for me to learn facts than to encode concepts, and i didn't understand that the only things worth having require effort until i had already dropped out of school


[02/13/2026 20:51] wintersloop_49457
i can read a math textbook and do the problems and know the material without actually needing to study anything


[02/13/2026 20:51] wintersloop_49457
history i have to read and rearead and reread and memorize etc


[02/13/2026 20:52] wintersloop_49457
make flash cards, write about it, it's like a whole process for the story to get into my bones


[02/13/2026 20:55] thesewhitelights
Is that still true?  The same process remains?  Or was it mostly limited to schooling?


[02/13/2026 20:57] wintersloop_49457
well, what i've come to learn over time is that history and literature are skills that compound themselves, and each other, they are conceptual in a lot of ways, there are just many many more concepts, so when i am doing the history of math and science, it is not hard, american history not so bad because i have read all of mccullough (fun fact, david mccullough's nephew is one of my closest friends in the world) but there are plenty of places where historical reading just slips out of my mind as soon as i read it, and yes i need to study it if i wanted to learn it, because there are not existing nearby concepts and structures to hold it in place


[02/13/2026 21:09] wintersloop_49457
how are you with these things, how do you learn?


[02/13/2026 21:10] wintersloop_49457
i also think that it is important for the history that i learn to have some kind of tether back to lived experience, if its completely abstract, may as well be fiction, that also becomes hard for me to absorb

[02/13/2026 21:35] wintersloop_49457
i think you will like this half of an opening anyways

[02/13/2026 21:40] wintersloop_49457
i will be ok though, when you are very busy, if i have to wait to hear from you


[02/13/2026 21:41] thesewhitelights
I know you are and will be

I will still offer reminders because sometimes a poke of perspective from outside of the immediate is nice

Tell me about Ireland


[02/13/2026 23:38] wintersloop_49457
basically they are doing an experiment where they pay around 2,000 artists who would otherwise not be able to support themselves via their art, $20,000/yr with no expectations or requirements etc


[02/13/2026 23:39] wintersloop_49457
three years later they will check back in on all these people and see how their art is (not like, quality, but are they making art and showing it etc) and decide whether to expand the program, typically UBI schemes like this face huge pressure from legislative opponents who say if we give people money for no reason they will just fuck off and not do anything with their lives, but experiments like this can help prove otherwise, that people are inherently motivated to do things with their lives, to make things, i think especially artists


[02/13/2026 23:42] thesewhitelights
And you like this


[02/13/2026 23:42] thesewhitelights
I like this


[02/13/2026 23:42] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/13/2026 23:42] wintersloop_49457
i like this


[02/13/2026 23:43] thesewhitelights
me too


[02/13/2026 23:43] wintersloop_49457
i thought you would


[02/13/2026 23:43] wintersloop_49457
you would like me to explain things instead of sending links, generally?


[02/13/2026 23:43] wintersloop_49457
i can do that


[02/13/2026 23:43] thesewhitelights
You've gotten good at the guessing game


[02/13/2026 23:45] thesewhitelights
I read the article and was excited you sent it.  I just wasn't sure what the motivation was for sending it, so I wanted to check to see if my suspicions were correct or if I was missing something.


[02/13/2026 23:45] wintersloop_49457
oh ok


[02/13/2026 23:46] wintersloop_49457
you thought maybe i didn't agree


[02/13/2026 23:46] thesewhitelights
*he keeps sending me treats*


[02/13/2026 23:46] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to always send treats


[02/13/2026 23:47] thesewhitelights
No, but I considered maybe there could be something specific in the content that stood out that I should have noticed.  Or maybe you also just liked the name Padraic.


[02/13/2026 23:48] wintersloop_49457
oh oh ok


[02/13/2026 23:48] wintersloop_49457
no i just wanted to send happy news today, i thought of you when i saw it


[02/13/2026 23:48] wintersloop_49457
because i sent unhappy news yesterday


[02/13/2026 23:49] thesewhitelights
For balance


[02/13/2026 23:49] wintersloop_49457
for balance


[02/13/2026 23:54] thesewhitelights
Do you remember your dreams?


[02/13/2026 23:54] wintersloop_49457
if i wake up naturally yes


[02/13/2026 23:54] wintersloop_49457
the alarm will clear my head


[02/13/2026 23:55] wintersloop_49457
maybe that is why i also like friday / saturday, i can keep those dreams the next day


[02/13/2026 23:55] wintersloop_49457
they start slipping very fast but i've learned to retrace them quickly too, i can usually retain a good amount if i try before doing anything else


[02/13/2026 23:56] wintersloop_49457
what about you


[02/14/2026 00:01] thesewhitelights
I tend to have very vivid dreams. I've learned how to kick myself out of the bad ones, and I've gotten much better at actively releasing and erasing them so they don't haunt me for the rest of the day.  The not so awful ones stick around, too.


[02/14/2026 00:02] wintersloop_49457
i'm sorry your dreams are hard on you sometimes but glad you can do that, do you meditate?


[02/14/2026 00:03] wintersloop_49457
i learned meditation in my 20s and that plus therapy did very good things to me


[02/14/2026 00:03] wintersloop_49457
including getting rid of bad dreams, almost entirely


[02/14/2026 00:05] thesewhitelights
I don't mind them.  I do mind them in the sense who wants to be unnerved while they're sleeping, but I also know they are just dreams.


[02/14/2026 00:05] thesewhitelights
I like to trace out the details and identify where they might have come from, things I've seen recently, people I've thought of, sounds and sights I've experienced


[02/14/2026 00:06] wintersloop_49457
mine mutate so much and so rapidly that they are mostly random and only vaguely connected to something going on irl


[02/14/2026 00:07] wintersloop_49457
you know how your expectation of what will happen is essentially what happens?


[02/14/2026 00:08] thesewhitelights
In dreams?


[02/14/2026 00:08] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 00:08] thesewhitelights
That makes sense


[02/14/2026 00:09] wintersloop_49457
for me i can see it happen in real time, and actually i can induce hypnogogia if i am well rested at bedtime


[02/14/2026 00:11] wintersloop_49457
i can be conscious of that happening, when i am unconscious i think that what happens to me is that engaging in the process of having an expectation, to me, involves trying to understand all of the things that could possibly happen next, and something somewhere inside me gets confused as to why we are doing that exactly, and it goes all sorts of directions that quickly bear no resemblance to where we started

What time do you typically wake up in the morning?


[02/14/2026 00:15] wintersloop_49457
there isn't a set time, it's a range of 8am-11am for almost all days though


[02/14/2026 00:15] wintersloop_49457
if i don't have an alarm set


[02/14/2026 00:16] wintersloop_49457
in a perfect world i would feel sleepy before midnight every night and close my eyes at midnight, and wake up at 8


[02/14/2026 00:17] thesewhitelights
Has that ever happened?


[02/14/2026 00:17] thesewhitelights
The perfect world


[02/14/2026 00:17] wintersloop_49457
yeah plenty of times, mostly when i'm on vacation


[02/14/2026 00:17] wintersloop_49457
i have no problem doing that


[02/14/2026 00:23] thesewhitelights
Are you a sandy beach vacation type of person?


[02/14/2026 00:24] wintersloop_49457
it doesn't matter much to me, really, usually vacation is about a person or people for me


[02/14/2026 00:24] thesewhitelights
I'm consistently an early riser.  In the summer months I usually wake up with the sun.  I have an alarm for workdays but rarely sleep until it goes off (6:21am)

⏰

[02/14/2026 00:24] wintersloop_49457
i take a break from work to spend time with friends or family


[02/14/2026 00:24] wintersloop_49457
as far as what i enjoy in terms of a destination, any nature is good


[02/14/2026 00:25] wintersloop_49457
beach, mountains, forest


[02/14/2026 00:25] wintersloop_49457
snow or no snow


[02/14/2026 00:25] wintersloop_49457
i like them all


[02/14/2026 00:26] thesewhitelights
I was going to ask you about winter.


[02/14/2026 00:26] wintersloop_49457
love skiing


[02/14/2026 00:26] wintersloop_49457
so much


[02/14/2026 00:26] wintersloop_49457
it's one of my favorite things to do


[02/14/2026 00:26] thesewhitelights
Noted.


[02/14/2026 00:27] wintersloop_49457
what about winter


[02/14/2026 00:27] thesewhitelights
I have not skiied!


[02/14/2026 00:27] wintersloop_49457
you would probably be great


[02/14/2026 00:27] wintersloop_49457
and you probably already know that


[02/14/2026 00:27] thesewhitelights
I would probably be not


[02/14/2026 00:27] thesewhitelights
What makes you think I would be great at it?


[02/14/2026 00:28] wintersloop_49457
you danced for so long that you're not going to lose the sense of how to balance yourself in less than perfect conditions


[02/14/2026 00:29] wintersloop_49457
once you have that it's almost entirely psychological, not being afraid to fall, finding the confidence to move, which again i think you would be fine with


[02/14/2026 00:29] wintersloop_49457
also you're short


[02/14/2026 00:30] wintersloop_49457
big advantage


[02/14/2026 00:31] thesewhitelights
It's possible


[02/14/2026 00:32] thesewhitelights
I spent an entire month learning how to fall.  It's all we did.  I don't remember much of it, but my body would probably remember with a little practice.

👌🏻

[02/14/2026 00:32] wintersloop_49457
you already get it


[02/14/2026 00:33] wintersloop_49457
it's not "don't fall", it's "don't be afraid to fall, you're going to fall"


[02/14/2026 00:34] thesewhitelights
My motto for life


[02/14/2026 00:35] wintersloop_49457
do you have other winter inquiries


[02/14/2026 00:36] wintersloop_49457
wait also what do *you* like for vacation


[02/14/2026 00:36] thesewhitelights
I was mostly curious if you can do winter.


[02/14/2026 00:36] thesewhitelights
It sounds like you do winter.


[02/14/2026 00:37] wintersloop_49457
i love sensations


[02/14/2026 00:37] wintersloop_49457
incl being hot and being cold as long as it's not dangerously so


[02/14/2026 00:38] thesewhitelights
You may be shocked to learn I feel the same way


[02/14/2026 00:38] wintersloop_49457
a little bit! that's so fun, i don't think i've ever met anyone who didn't think this was weird


[02/14/2026 00:39] wintersloop_49457
i like all of the experiences, this is why i go to a restaurant and order the thing that is the most foreign to me


[02/14/2026 00:39] wintersloop_49457
i want to know what everything tastes like and feels like


[02/14/2026 00:40] thesewhitelights
It is weird to other people because they like comfort and what they know?


[02/14/2026 00:40] wintersloop_49457
i think that's exactly it


[02/14/2026 00:41] wintersloop_49457
this is also why there are so many things i don't have a preference on, i want to expose myself to things, not just one thing


[02/14/2026 00:42] thesewhitelights
I think that's really admirable


[02/14/2026 00:42] wintersloop_49457
is that not where you are coming from? or is yours more narrowly focused on touch senses


[02/14/2026 00:43] thesewhitelights
I stay close to some things, but I also like to be challenged


[02/14/2026 00:44] wintersloop_49457
actually hot and cold are unique in that they are penetrating sensations that are not just touch sensations, i guess


[02/14/2026 00:45] wintersloop_49457
speakerbox bass too


[02/14/2026 00:46] thesewhitelights
And Grandma's Good Vibrations


[02/14/2026 00:46] wintersloop_49457
lmao


[02/14/2026 00:47] wintersloop_49457
don't forget the human centrifuge and/or bungee jumping, skydiving, et al


[02/14/2026 00:47] thesewhitelights
These are also things you do?


[02/14/2026 00:47] wintersloop_49457
yeah


[02/14/2026 00:47] wintersloop_49457
i haven't been skydiving yet actually but there is no way i won't go someday


[02/14/2026 00:48] wintersloop_49457
the rest of the things yes


[02/14/2026 00:48] thesewhitelights
There is no way!


[02/14/2026 00:48] wintersloop_49457
impossible, i'm gonna go


[02/14/2026 00:48] thesewhitelights
My cheeks hurt from smiling


[02/14/2026 00:49] wintersloop_49457
feels nice


[02/14/2026 00:49] wintersloop_49457
to make you smile


[02/14/2026 00:50] thesewhitelights
You are good at it.  Without trying.


[02/14/2026 00:50] wintersloop_49457
hell yeah


[02/14/2026 00:51] thesewhitelights
I made two people cry today.


[02/14/2026 00:51] wintersloop_49457
good tears or bad tears


[02/14/2026 00:51] wintersloop_49457
or if we want to always stay positive, growth tears or relief tears


[02/14/2026 00:52] thesewhitelights
Relief tears


[02/14/2026 00:52] thesewhitelights
Being seen tears


[02/14/2026 00:52] wintersloop_49457
oh good


[02/14/2026 00:52] wintersloop_49457
that also feels so good


[02/14/2026 00:52] wintersloop_49457
i'm happy for you and them today


[02/14/2026 00:52] thesewhitelights
I don't love that my little bit had such a big impact


[02/14/2026 00:53] thesewhitelights
I'd rather they experience more relief on a regular basis


[02/14/2026 00:53] thesewhitelights
One was a student.  One was a professor.


[02/14/2026 00:54] thesewhitelights
I'm glad I could give them my attention.


[02/14/2026 00:55] wintersloop_49457
you're good at being a mirror and a shovel both


[02/14/2026 00:55] wintersloop_49457
many people do not have access to these tools anywhere


[02/14/2026 00:56] wintersloop_49457
which you already must know


[02/14/2026 00:57] wintersloop_49457
but my point is, wouldn't you expect it to be the case that some people are way more likely to find what they need while they're with you?


[02/14/2026 00:57] thesewhitelights
Because of the position I'm in?


[02/14/2026 00:58] thesewhitelights
No


[02/14/2026 00:58] thesewhitelights
Because of the person I am, yes


[02/14/2026 00:58] wintersloop_49457
well because it's appropriate for you to provide them access to the tools in your function, isn't it?


[02/14/2026 00:58] thesewhitelights
Yes, that's what the job is, but that is often done with very little genuine care or vested interest


[02/14/2026 00:59] wintersloop_49457
truth


[02/14/2026 00:59] wintersloop_49457
mental health lip service everywhere


[02/14/2026 01:00] wintersloop_49457
i've helped fight that battle at uber, it was sad


[02/14/2026 01:00] thesewhitelights
What time will we stare at each other tomorrow?


[02/14/2026 01:02] wintersloop_49457
whenever works for you


[02/14/2026 01:03] wintersloop_49457
i say we pick a bedtime, and then pick an amount of time that seems unreasonable for us to be on the call for, and subtract


[02/14/2026 01:04] thesewhitelights
I asked so we could pick a bedtime


[02/14/2026 01:05] wintersloop_49457
haha, well tell me what bedtime you want


[02/14/2026 01:05] wintersloop_49457
and then i think we should subtract 4.5 hours


[02/14/2026 01:08] thesewhitelights
Is this a bedtime that accounts for the probability that the first goodnight will be a lie?


[02/14/2026 01:08] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 01:11] thesewhitelights
Wil you eat dinner?


[02/14/2026 01:16] thesewhitelights
You're the one in the future, so I think you should be picking this bedtime.  I've kept you up WAY too late this past week


[02/14/2026 01:18] wintersloop_49457
i'll eat like right before our call, whenever that is


[02/14/2026 01:18] wintersloop_49457
my dinnertime is flexible


[02/14/2026 01:18] wintersloop_49457
ok let me do my own math and you can tell me if it's acceptable


[02/14/2026 01:19] wintersloop_49457
oh i see you are kinda right


[02/14/2026 01:20] wintersloop_49457
if i date a true 3am bedtime (no lies) that means a 5:30pm start for you


[02/14/2026 01:20] wintersloop_49457
which seems early


[02/14/2026 01:20] wintersloop_49457
but that is what the numbers say


[02/14/2026 01:21] thesewhitelights
That works for me


[02/14/2026 01:21] wintersloop_49457
ok cool


[02/14/2026 01:21] wintersloop_49457
thank you


[02/14/2026 01:21] wintersloop_49457
for being you


[02/14/2026 01:22] thesewhitelights
Even though I hedged around having to pick the time?


[02/14/2026 01:24] thesewhitelights
I just finished your valentine, which you will see but not receive tomorrow because some of us still build on blank pieces of paper


[02/14/2026 01:24] wintersloop_49457
oh yay


[02/14/2026 01:25] thesewhitelights
How are you feeling?


[02/14/2026 01:26] wintersloop_49457
i guess mostly happy


[02/14/2026 01:26] wintersloop_49457
i am pretty focused on you at the moment


[02/14/2026 01:26] wintersloop_49457
and not worrying about my troubles right now


[02/14/2026 01:26] wintersloop_49457
they creep into my mind in little bits though


[02/14/2026 01:27] thesewhitelights
Is happy a neutral state for you, or is it elevated?


[02/14/2026 01:29] wintersloop_49457
this is an elevated mood from my normal friday, i would say that if you ask me how i feel on any given day i would say something like content, or if i did a good job on making something i would say fulfilled


[02/14/2026 01:29] thesewhitelights
So happy is a different flavor


[02/14/2026 01:29] wintersloop_49457
yeah


[02/14/2026 01:29] thesewhitelights
I'm taking notes.  Thank you for completing my survey.


[02/14/2026 01:29] thesewhitelights
This happy is a different flavor for me, too.


[02/14/2026 01:30] wintersloop_49457
can you tell me about that


[02/14/2026 01:30] wintersloop_49457
how is it different


[02/14/2026 01:38] thesewhitelights
This happy feels heavier, and I feel lighter


[02/14/2026 01:38] thesewhitelights
But heavy like a thick quilt on a cold winter night

[02/14/2026 01:48] wintersloop_49457
he's coming around to my side


[02/14/2026 01:49] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 01:49] wintersloop_49457
how about monday morning amy?


[02/14/2026 01:50] thesewhitelights
He's impressed?


[02/14/2026 01:50] thesewhitelights
Monday morning Amy is yelling at me to finish the truffles because on Monday morning that was the most significant thing that we would do this week


[02/14/2026 01:51] wintersloop_49457
well tell her the bowl is gone now


[02/14/2026 01:51] wintersloop_49457

oh! i didn't know yet


[02/14/2026 01:52] wintersloop_49457
yes monday morning mike is impressed because i have put in the cheat code for allowing yourself to feel for someone you just met, you reminded me of what it is


[02/14/2026 01:53] thesewhitelights
Are you usually guarded?


[02/14/2026 01:53] thesewhitelights
Intentionally or unintentionally

i'm usually practical and planning, and don't want to be guarded, but practicality and planning will cause me to realize that it's not smart to let my feelings run out ahead of my pragmatism


[02/14/2026 01:54] wintersloop_49457
so the cheat code is to not worry about tomorrow until it's practically here


[02/14/2026 01:56] thesewhitelights
So you get to stay in now


[02/14/2026 01:56] wintersloop_49457
i'm not catching your meaning but yes to whatever you're saying


[02/14/2026 01:57] thesewhitelights
hahaha I could be spouting nonsense


[02/14/2026 01:57] wintersloop_49457
well i agree with you

[02/14/2026 02:00] thesewhitelights
Have you tired of my questions?


[02/14/2026 02:00] wintersloop_49457
no i'm sitting on my couch, and i will never tire of your questions


[02/14/2026 02:00] thesewhitelights
Never is an absolute


[02/14/2026 02:00] wintersloop_49457
ok how many do you think you need


[02/14/2026 02:01] wintersloop_49457
i could do maybe ten thousand


[02/14/2026 02:01] thesewhitelights
Per month, or....

[02/14/2026 02:02] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 02:02] thesewhitelights
I used to be a teaching professor


[02/14/2026 02:02] thesewhitelights
I quit because of that meme


[02/14/2026 02:03] wintersloop_49457
oh no i'm sorry is this upsetting or is it a friend to you


[02/14/2026 02:03] thesewhitelights
I had a very good


[02/14/2026 02:03] thesewhitelights
laugh


[02/14/2026 02:03] wintersloop_49457
ok sweet


[02/14/2026 02:05] thesewhitelights
We hired a new director for our program who looks eerily like the woman in that meme.  The director was also inept in many ways.


[02/14/2026 02:05] thesewhitelights
She is the reason I left.


[02/14/2026 02:05] wintersloop_49457
aha


[02/14/2026 02:05] wintersloop_49457
so it's friend


[02/14/2026 02:06] thesewhitelights
But an exchange of the meme in a private chat during a staff meeting on Zoom is what solidified my decision


[02/14/2026 02:07] thesewhitelights
So the meme is a friend


[02/14/2026 02:09] thesewhitelights
My friend Meg quit the same time I did.  She decided to leave and had announced it months before I realized it was also my time.  Meg and her husband Will and their two kids moved to the coast.  You asked about vacations earlier.  The only vacation-eque time I take is about a week during the summer to visit them.  That week is not a relaxing time.  It is a stressful time.  But it is very full of love regardless.


[02/14/2026 02:10] wintersloop_49457
that sounds nice


[02/14/2026 02:11] wintersloop_49457
i go over to ari's house a lot, he has been my best friend of 32 years, him and his wife have two daughters, 3 and 5 now


[02/14/2026 02:12] wintersloop_49457
it's a lot


[02/14/2026 02:12] wintersloop_49457
but i go all the time


[02/14/2026 02:13] thesewhitelights
My kids (Meg & Will's kids) are 4 and 9.  It's gotten easier to manage their overwhelming love and demand for my attention as they've gotten older


[02/14/2026 02:14] wintersloop_49457
oh good


[02/14/2026 02:15] wintersloop_49457
mercifully this year they have picked up an extraordinarily quiet and boring interest which is pokemon cards, which they still manage to make into a much bigger deal than it is, but the baseline is low


[02/14/2026 02:16] wintersloop_49457
i made them custom pokemon binders for christmas for like $3 and it was their favorie present, beth (ari's wife) was mad at me


[02/14/2026 02:16] thesewhitelights
Nicely done!!!


[02/14/2026 02:17] wintersloop_49457
oh i can teach you a fun thing about me


[02/14/2026 02:18] thesewhitelights
Please please please


[02/14/2026 02:18] wintersloop_49457
you have to promise not to steal her book


[02/14/2026 02:18] wintersloop_49457
so, some background


[02/14/2026 02:19] thesewhitelights
I don't make promises I don't know if I can keep, and this ambiguous promise falls into that category


[02/14/2026 02:19] wintersloop_49457
whenever i ask beth what she's reading, almost always it is some kind of high grade soft pornography novel


[02/14/2026 02:19] wintersloop_49457
essentially every time


[02/14/2026 02:19] wintersloop_49457
and i guess nobody else asks her about her books? or maybe she just answers me honestly


[02/14/2026 02:20] wintersloop_49457
so it is a running gag where i tease her about her book choices and she'll share details of the book with me because she knows i am either uncomfortable or at the very least bored about them


[02/14/2026 02:21] wintersloop_49457
so this year, she inspired something in me, it is a kind of christmas present that i invented myself


[02/14/2026 02:21] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 02:22] wintersloop_49457
this is not the book jacket, i went and found those actual quotes about the book though and thought it was hilarious


[02/14/2026 02:22] wintersloop_49457
and made my own book jacket


[02/14/2026 02:22] wintersloop_49457
then, i go on audible and i give *myself* a gift link to the audiobook by putting my own email in as the gift recipient, then i turn the link into a qr code


[02/14/2026 02:23] wintersloop_49457
then this becomes the outside of a card, and i sign the inside and write a little note


[02/14/2026 02:23] wintersloop_49457
she gave me the idea but then i just did this for all of my christmas presents this year


[02/14/2026 02:24] wintersloop_49457
the conciet is, you can hand someone an audiobook physically, and it's handmade and if i'm inspired enough, entertaining


[02/14/2026 02:24] thesewhitelights
this is brilliant


[02/14/2026 02:25] thesewhitelights
I have another comment on it, but it doesn't come in words


[02/14/2026 02:25] wintersloop_49457
i hope we are banking these


[02/14/2026 02:26] thesewhitelights
I don't believe there will be a shortage


[02/14/2026 02:26] wintersloop_49457
you are probably right because i really like to make things for people i like


[02/14/2026 02:28] thesewhitelights
you're a merrymaker


[02/14/2026 02:28] thesewhitelights
like me


[02/14/2026 02:28] wintersloop_49457
yis


[02/14/2026 02:30] thesewhitelights
how


[02/14/2026 02:30] thesewhitelights
That's a rhetorical question


[02/14/2026 02:30] thesewhitelights
an expression of disbelief


[02/14/2026 02:32] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 02:33] thesewhitelights
Precisely


[02/14/2026 02:38] wintersloop_49457
i think that feeling came really soon actually


[02/14/2026 02:39] thesewhitelights
Did it bother you?


[02/14/2026 02:40] wintersloop_49457
it wasn't that it bothered me exactly


[02/14/2026 02:40] wintersloop_49457
i need a different unknown emotion word


[02/14/2026 02:40] wintersloop_49457
which is when something highly unlikely happens


[02/14/2026 02:40] thesewhitelights
Soon also seems relative when the total timeline is days

[02/14/2026 02:40] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 02:40] wintersloop_49457
it is usually a scam


[02/14/2026 02:40] wintersloop_49457
but this was clearly not a scam


[02/14/2026 02:40] wintersloop_49457
so it was more like disbelief, confusion


[02/14/2026 02:41] thesewhitelights
I know the feeling


[02/14/2026 02:41] thesewhitelights
I felt the feeling


[02/14/2026 02:41] thesewhitelights
I feel the feeling


[02/14/2026 02:42] wintersloop_49457

I liked sleeping with you last night


[02/14/2026 02:49] thesewhitelights
I know neither of us actually slept in our respective spaces, but I slept soundly in the one that we shared


[02/14/2026 02:49] wintersloop_49457
me too, that was good


[02/14/2026 02:51] wintersloop_49457
i don't hug the pillow when i sleep


[02/14/2026 02:51] wintersloop_49457
some people have a pillow for their head and then a pillow like a stuffed animal that they hold


[02/14/2026 02:51] wintersloop_49457
i was a never a fan of this


[02/14/2026 02:52] wintersloop_49457
but, i discovered last night that i *am* a fan of just willing your presence into place right next to me


[02/14/2026 02:52] wintersloop_49457
and if you had told monday mike that he would have been highly sus of what kind of drugs had been given to me


[02/14/2026 02:54] thesewhitelights
Because the limited length of time between Monday and Thursday


[02/14/2026 02:55] wintersloop_49457
no because that seems too similar to the pillow holding


[02/14/2026 02:55] wintersloop_49457
maybe partally length of time


[02/14/2026 02:55] wintersloop_49457
maybe some more elaboration


[02/14/2026 02:56] wintersloop_49457
i think the reason people like the pillow is that they get a feeling of comfort similar to holding a person


[02/14/2026 02:56] wintersloop_49457
obviously it's not the same thing, but on some level, you get some comfort like that


[02/14/2026 02:56] wintersloop_49457
that doesn't work for me at all


[02/14/2026 02:57] wintersloop_49457
so if i had asked myself "well do you think imagining someone right there with you would make you sleep easier, give you comfort on some level as if they were there"


[02/14/2026 02:57] wintersloop_49457
my answer would have been no


[02/14/2026 02:57] wintersloop_49457
but my intuition was wrong


[02/14/2026 02:58] thesewhitelights
I'm following


[02/14/2026 02:58] thesewhitelights
I'm glad it did


[02/14/2026 02:59] wintersloop_49457
is there anything else i can do for you on the call tomorrow other than your two requests


[02/14/2026 03:00] thesewhitelights
be you to the best of your ability


[02/14/2026 03:00] thesewhitelights
as you are


[02/14/2026 03:00] thesewhitelights
however that is


[02/14/2026 03:00] wintersloop_49457
i got it


[02/14/2026 03:00] wintersloop_49457
that is easy with you


[02/14/2026 03:01] thesewhitelights
It could be different when we're animated


[02/14/2026 03:01] wintersloop_49457
i don't think so


[02/14/2026 03:01] wintersloop_49457
sometimes i wonder if there is a chance that beauty like yours will rewire my monkey brain in ways that i have no control over, but i think that still suits your request

[02/14/2026 03:05] thesewhitelights
I am not a fan of movies that have raging monkeys in them


[02/14/2026 03:05] thesewhitelights
Such as the start of many zombie movies


[02/14/2026 03:05] wintersloop_49457
i don't know if i have seen many movies like that?


[02/14/2026 03:05] thesewhitelights
Fan of the movies, possibly, but fan of the monkey parts, no sir


[02/14/2026 03:05] wintersloop_49457
maybe i'm just forgetting


[02/14/2026 03:05] wintersloop_49457
we have never even talked about movies or tv! do you watch much?


[02/14/2026 03:05] thesewhitelights
28 Days Later is an example


[02/14/2026 03:06] thesewhitelights
We have never even talked about many things!


[02/14/2026 03:07] thesewhitelights
I believe my answer to your question has to be yes


[02/14/2026 03:07] thesewhitelights
I usually have something playing in the background when I'm knitting, and I watch a lot of things with my friend Renee as a bonding friend thing


[02/14/2026 03:08] wintersloop_49457
i think we're similar, i have something on while coding


[02/14/2026 03:08] wintersloop_49457
i don't have friends over much, but movies are a common theme


[02/14/2026 03:08] thesewhitelights
Earlier in my life when my headaches were bad, I'd almost always have something playing as a distraction so it wasn't just me and the pain hanging out for hours and days at a time, but I don't have a lot of recall of that media


[02/14/2026 03:09] thesewhitelights
Oh, Renee doesn't come over.  She is curled up on her couch with the dogs, and I'm curled up on my couch with Ted, and we just press play at the same time and text our commentary


[02/14/2026 03:09] wintersloop_49457
i'm sorry you hurt like that


[02/14/2026 03:09] wintersloop_49457
ahhh haha ok


[02/14/2026 03:10] thesewhitelights
If I hadn't hurt like that, I wouldn't be who I am now


[02/14/2026 03:10] wintersloop_49457
this is true


[02/14/2026 03:10] wintersloop_49457
i wouldn't be either, tbh


[02/14/2026 03:12] thesewhitelights
Some things may have been awful by some definitions, but it is the only life I've known and the only one I'll have.  I'm grateful for what it gave me, especially because I don't know all that it took away.

What do you like to have on while you're coding?


[02/14/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
it depends on what kind of coding, if it is a hobby project or something i enjoy, like your site i made, i tend to like foreign serialized content


[02/14/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
i watch a lot of britbox


[02/14/2026 03:14] thesewhitelights
I need you to stop saying the right things.


[02/14/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
if it's for work, and i don't want to do it, i put music on and crank


[02/14/2026 03:14] thesewhitelights
(please don't stop saying the right things)


[02/14/2026 03:15] wintersloop_49457
is this what you like?


[02/14/2026 03:15] wintersloop_49457
unreal if so, how specifically though


[02/14/2026 03:15] thesewhitelights
Yes.


[02/14/2026 03:15] wintersloop_49457
britbox?


[02/14/2026 03:15] thesewhitelights
In my dreams


[02/14/2026 03:15] thesewhitelights
I watch what I can stream on PBS


[02/14/2026 03:16] wintersloop_49457
ohhh ok yeah they still have good stuff on there


[02/14/2026 03:16] wintersloop_49457
i tack on britbox to amazon prime for $5/mo i think and that's mostly what i watch


[02/14/2026 03:17] wintersloop_49457
i can stream britbox to you, this would be a good date night then?

[02/14/2026 03:22] wintersloop_49457
i don't think this will make you uncomfortable, but i apologize ahead of time if it does, i want to see how you are shaped, if that makes sense?


[02/14/2026 03:22] wintersloop_49457
we can stand up and a little away from the camera so we know what each others shapes are like?


[02/14/2026 03:24] wintersloop_49457
(not for the whole call just for like, a little bit)


[02/14/2026 03:25] thesewhitelights
This does not make me uncomfortable, and I was hoping that would happen


[02/14/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
ok good!


[02/14/2026 03:25] thesewhitelights
I will need confirmation that you have legs


[02/14/2026 03:25] thesewhitelights
(I actually don't care if you don't)


[02/14/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
haha ok


[02/14/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 03:29] thesewhitelights
I have been rethinking one of my show-and-tell items


[02/14/2026 03:30] wintersloop_49457
i don't have a lot of physical things i care about


[02/14/2026 03:30] wintersloop_49457
do you need me to help you decide


[02/14/2026 03:30] thesewhitelights
I taught elementary in a previous lifetime, and I loved show-and-tell because the default item was gym shoes


[02/14/2026 03:31] thesewhitelights
At least with my small group of kids


[02/14/2026 03:31] wintersloop_49457
oh, haha like if they didn't bring something, they would reliably have gym shoes?


[02/14/2026 03:31] thesewhitelights
Yes


[02/14/2026 03:31] thesewhitelights
No fewer than 3 times Hunter Johnson showed us his gym shoes and told us about them


[02/14/2026 03:32] wintersloop_49457
amazing, good job hunter


[02/14/2026 03:32] thesewhitelights
The gym shoes that we saw him wear several times a week


[02/14/2026 03:32] thesewhitelights

You would not find sleeping with a handsy aubergine comforting?


[02/14/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457
i've been wrong before


[02/14/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457
i do like to try all of the sensations out at least


[02/14/2026 03:41] thesewhitelights
Knowing my presence, it was making some of those moves on you


[02/14/2026 03:41] wintersloop_49457
haha, i bet she was


[02/14/2026 03:42] wintersloop_49457
have i told you that i love back scratches, a lot


[02/14/2026 03:43] wintersloop_49457
i empathize with every doggo i scratch, and then when i stop they look at me and i know the feels


[02/14/2026 03:43] wintersloop_49457
just keep scratching


[02/14/2026 03:43] wintersloop_49457
please


[02/14/2026 03:43] thesewhitelights
Have I told you that I am the most sought after and adored dogsitter because I absently scritch for hours on end?

[02/14/2026 03:44] wintersloop_49457
you cannot possibly be a real person


[02/14/2026 03:44] thesewhitelights
I was just thinking the same thing about you


[02/14/2026 03:44] wintersloop_49457
you're an elaborate joke constructed by my friends and family so i will feel known in this world


[02/14/2026 03:44] thesewhitelights
Like I just walked over to the counter and said, "No" out loud


[02/14/2026 03:45] thesewhitelights
I'm flattered you believe I possess the talent it would take to pull something like that off


[02/14/2026 03:47] wintersloop_49457
is the book good


[02/14/2026 03:48] wintersloop_49457
i guess that's not actually the question i have


[02/14/2026 03:48] wintersloop_49457
the question i have is, is the book the kind of book that works on your brain


[02/14/2026 03:49] thesewhitelights
It is.


[02/14/2026 03:50] thesewhitelights
All of the way yes.


[02/14/2026 03:50] wintersloop_49457
by my calculations it's going to take 1000-1500 hours to actually do it


[02/14/2026 03:51] wintersloop_49457
so probably years


[02/14/2026 03:51] wintersloop_49457
unless i drop out of business all together and just write


[02/14/2026 03:52] wintersloop_49457
my point is i want to be sure it is going to scratch someone's brain correctly before i do it


[02/14/2026 03:52] wintersloop_49457
yours is nice


[02/14/2026 03:52] thesewhitelights
But potentially biased


[02/14/2026 03:53] wintersloop_49457
i'd be ok if you were the only person that read it


[02/14/2026 03:53] thesewhitelights
Not if it took you 1500 hours


[02/14/2026 03:53] wintersloop_49457
but what is more interesting is the idea that people *like you* in some ways will like it


[02/14/2026 03:53] thesewhitelights
If I had come across the chunks I read at a time when I had no knowledge of your existence, I would have wanted to read more.  It does tickle me in the right ways.

[02/14/2026 03:53] wintersloop_49457
that is a fine audience, even if poorly defined


[02/14/2026 03:54] wintersloop_49457
and i'm kinda halfway joking, if i was the only person who ever read the book, it would still be satisfying to me to have worked through what i want to say


[02/14/2026 03:54] wintersloop_49457
but i would also like to say it to someone, a person


[02/14/2026 03:55] wintersloop_49457
you are a really good choice, if i had to pick just one


[02/14/2026 03:55] thesewhitelights
I'm honored


[02/14/2026 03:55] thesewhitelights
Truly


[02/14/2026 03:55] thesewhitelights
You know that, yes?


[02/14/2026 03:56] wintersloop_49457
yeah i do, i always take what you're saying literally unless there's a good reason to think otherwise, unless something doesn't fit


[02/14/2026 03:57] thesewhitelights
Just making sure


[02/14/2026 03:58] thesewhitelights
People say things politely, I say things sincerely.


[02/14/2026 03:58] wintersloop_49457
i know you do


[02/14/2026 03:58] wintersloop_49457
i do too, at least to you


[02/14/2026 03:59] thesewhitelights
I believe that


[02/14/2026 04:03] wintersloop_49457
do you know chromeo


[02/14/2026 04:03] thesewhitelights
The name yes


[02/14/2026 04:05] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 04:25] thesewhitelights
These truffles are going to be extra tasty


[02/14/2026 04:25] wintersloop_49457
i know they are


[02/14/2026 04:25] wintersloop_49457
what's your favorite candybar, out of the classics


[02/14/2026 04:25] thesewhitelights
I was iffy about them before (I just tossed some stuff together to see what would happen), but now I'm feeling confident


[02/14/2026 04:26] thesewhitelights
I don't think I can pick a favorite.  Nothing comes to mind as a standout


[02/14/2026 04:26] wintersloop_49457
oh, this one i do have a favorite, or maybe two that trade places depending on mood


[02/14/2026 04:26] wintersloop_49457
caramello and heath bar


[02/14/2026 04:27] thesewhitelights
I was going to pick Heath!


[02/14/2026 04:27] thesewhitelights
Do you scrape the chocolate off the toffee with your teeth?


[02/14/2026 04:27] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 04:27] wintersloop_49457
at this point we shouldn't be surprised


[02/14/2026 04:27] wintersloop_49457
we are going to have to adjust our understanding of how reality works


[02/14/2026 04:28] thesewhitelights
I'm already not 100% convinced I'm awake right now


[02/14/2026 04:28] thesewhitelights
This could be a dream


[02/14/2026 04:28] thesewhitelights
A very, very, very, very good dream


[02/14/2026 04:31] wintersloop_49457
did you pull up r4r or did my post show up on your main feed


[02/14/2026 04:31] thesewhitelights
I enter manually


[02/14/2026 04:32] wintersloop_49457
that's my lockwood voice, the post


[02/14/2026 04:33] wintersloop_49457
if you don't want to read books i can read hers aloud to you


[02/14/2026 04:33] wintersloop_49457
i want you to know her


[02/14/2026 04:33] thesewhitelights
I accept


[02/14/2026 04:33] thesewhitelights
But I also want to read


[02/14/2026 04:33] wintersloop_49457
ok we can do both


[02/14/2026 04:36] thesewhitelights
Did you ever watch the show Home Movies?


[02/14/2026 04:37] thesewhitelights
It's animated


[02/14/2026 04:37] wintersloop_49457
i've seen it but not intentionally


[02/14/2026 04:44] thesewhitelights
I'm not sure how I was introduced to it because I never saw it when it aired, but I have a DVD set of the first season.  I also don't know how I acquired the DVD set, but I'm glad that I did.  The show is about these kids who make movies.  In one of my favorite episodes, they make a rock opera about Franz Kafka.  It is gold, but maybe not to anyone who doesn't know the show? The Kafka episode also includes appearances from Louis Pasteur and Louis Braille (who are vying for the title of THE best Louis, I believe).  The references to Pasteur in your book ---> favorite Home Movies episode --> me singing the Kafka musical for most of the day

i do love kafka


[02/14/2026 04:46] wintersloop_49457
and the thought of you singing this


[02/14/2026 04:47] thesewhitelights
"I got little tiny bug feet.  I don't really know what bugs eat"


[02/14/2026 04:49] thesewhitelights
Singing it incorrectly, clearly, but Ted doesn't care


[02/14/2026 04:50] wintersloop_49457
oh have i told you that i'm the worst singer you can possibly imagine


[02/14/2026 04:51] wintersloop_49457
and then when i was young people made fun of me which just reinforced my belief that i should not sing which just made it worse because i never tried


[02/14/2026 04:51] wintersloop_49457
i am over the embarrassment of it, it's just still so terrible


[02/14/2026 04:51] wintersloop_49457
so, so bad


[02/14/2026 04:51] thesewhitelights
I was in a choir, and I was asked to lip sync


[02/14/2026 04:52] wintersloop_49457
ok we can be terrible together i love this


[02/14/2026 04:52] thesewhitelights
And I was in the wizard of oz musical and had to sing a duet with a trained vocalist and I absolutely just mouthed the words during the performance with no sound coming out

[02/14/2026 04:54] wintersloop_49457
is that why you don't like monkeys in your movies


[02/14/2026 04:55] thesewhitelights
I have been trying not to let my imagination dream up scenes of potentially impossible things, but it's becoming increasingly difficult


[02/14/2026 04:55] thesewhitelights
No, I don't like raging monkeys in movies because I had a somewhat reoccurring dream about rabid monkeys killing people I knew

And then I cried and they all freaked out because I was actually the toughest one in the entire bunch

Welcome.  I've been here for a while.  The water is terrifying.


[02/14/2026 05:39] wintersloop_49457
do you want to try and help me with ideas


[02/14/2026 05:46] thesewhitelights
Ideas?


[02/14/2026 05:47] wintersloop_49457
there was a woman named emmy noether


[02/14/2026 05:48] wintersloop_49457
she was a physicist / mathematician, einstien called her work fundamental to all of physics which is relatively high praise


[02/14/2026 05:48] wintersloop_49457
and her life is tragic


[02/14/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
so she is perfect for the book but i don't know what to do with her


[02/14/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
what point to make


[02/14/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
i have words, but they don't contribute to the story or meaning or anything


[02/14/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
> Emmy Noether's youngest brother, Gustav, was mentally disabled. He spent most of his life in an institution and died in 1928 at the age of thirty-nine. Her other brother, Alfred, earned a doctorate in chemistry and died in 1918, the same year she published Invariante Variationsprobleme. Of the four Noether children, one was institutionalized, one died young, one was tortured and shot by the NKVD, and one proved that the universe must conserve certain quantities whenever its laws display a particular kind of symmetry. The universe has been quietly obeying her proof ever since, in every interaction between every particle in every galaxy, without interruption, without exception, without once, in the century since she wrote it, conserving anything about the woman who proved it. Her paper was not translated into English until 1971, thirty-six years after her death, when it appeared in a journal called Transport Theory and Statistical Physics, which is exactly the kind of obscure publication you would expect for a result that merely explains why anything in the universe is allowed to persist. It was not called "Noether's Theorem" in a standard physics textbook until 1980, when Herbert Goldstein added a section with that title to his second edition, which is to say it took forty-five years and a great deal of dying before the theorem that explains conservation was conserved under her name. She has no tombstone. She has a walkway. Students cross it between classes, in a hurry, notebooks open, not looking down. Underneath their feet, the ashes of a woman who proved that certain things cannot be lost. The universe, which is bound by her proof, does not appear to consider this a contradiction.


[02/14/2026 05:53] wintersloop_49457
and then as stimulant, or source, for what her work says, which is what she should say herself, ideally


[02/14/2026 05:53] wintersloop_49457
> Noether's theorem says if the rules of a system don't change when you shift your perspective in some way, then something must be conserved. The deep insight is that conservation isn't a separate fact about the universe. It's a consequence of symmetry. Things persist because the rules don't play favorites about when or where or which way. If the rules did change depending on when you looked, energy would leak. If they changed depending on where you stood, momentum would vanish. The universe keeps things because the universe is fair.


[02/14/2026 05:53] wintersloop_49457
so like, it's right there


[02/14/2026 05:54] wintersloop_49457
fairness, equality


[02/14/2026 05:56] wintersloop_49457
so the game is to reverse engineer plot elements (literally anything you can think of that is a story of any kind) which we tell a part of a story as, then the interlude between chapters will be about noether, or maybe the run-up to the chapter


[02/14/2026 05:56] wintersloop_49457
you do not have to play this game if you don't like it, i can't think anymore so i thought i would show you what i am doing, and maybe you can think


[02/14/2026 05:59] thesewhitelights
I'm reading through it


[02/14/2026 06:00] thesewhitelights
I think you're missing a child


[02/14/2026 06:01] wintersloop_49457
four childrem, 1. one institutionalized, 2. one died young, 3. tortured, 4. emmy


[02/14/2026 06:01] wintersloop_49457
2 needs more explanation


[02/14/2026 06:02] thesewhitelights
We get names and lives of 3 and then this tortured nameless soul shows up in the next sentence

that is not all I will think on it, but probably for tonight.  I just crawled into bed.


[02/14/2026 06:03] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 06:18] wintersloop_49457
this is the week I met Amy


[02/14/2026 06:18] wintersloop_49457
i think i'm going to give you your own pellet


[02/14/2026 06:18] wintersloop_49457
this will make sense to you tomorrow


[02/14/2026 06:19] wintersloop_49457
can you think of an answer to this question though: is there a thing i can do for you, or with you, every day


[02/14/2026 06:19] wintersloop_49457
it could be as simple as just send you a message, that's the thing you want every day


[02/14/2026 06:20] thesewhitelights
Does it have to be a thing I see?


[02/14/2026 06:20] wintersloop_49457
no


[02/14/2026 06:20] thesewhitelights
I've picked something


[02/14/2026 06:20] wintersloop_49457
excellent


[02/14/2026 06:20] thesewhitelights
I can pick something else if you don't like it


[02/14/2026 06:21] thesewhitelights
Do I save the thing for tomorrow?


[02/14/2026 06:21] wintersloop_49457
you can tell me whenever, if you want to surprise me it's fine


[02/14/2026 06:22] thesewhitelights
Oh I wasn't sure if this was related to the pellet I will learn about tomorrow


[02/14/2026 06:22] wintersloop_49457
yes it is


[02/14/2026 06:23] wintersloop_49457
```
thanks for being amy.

[02/14/2026 06:26] thesewhitelights
Aren't you tired?


[02/14/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
yeah i was debating saying i should go to sleep about 15 min ago


[02/14/2026 06:27] wintersloop_49457
i'm just enjoying the denouement of our celebratory week


[02/14/2026 06:28] thesewhitelights
Tomorrow is a different holiday altogether


[02/14/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
completely new


[02/14/2026 06:28] thesewhitelights
There is no coming back from tomorrow


[02/14/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
good


[02/14/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
although i don't even know if i could actually dig in any harder after that valentine


[02/14/2026 06:29] thesewhitelights
Just show up


[02/14/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
👌🏻


[02/14/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
that's it


[02/14/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
show up on time


[02/14/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
that's usually how i describe what effort means when i say effort is required


[02/14/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
show up on time


[02/14/2026 06:30] thesewhitelights
Will effort be required


[02/14/2026 06:30] thesewhitelights
?


[02/14/2026 06:30] wintersloop_49457
as in my three things i need: effort, grace, peace


[02/14/2026 06:30] thesewhitelights
You switched the order


[02/14/2026 06:30] wintersloop_49457
no they are all equal


[02/14/2026 06:31] wintersloop_49457
there is no order, it's pyramid that sometimes people want shifted around
``` 
     honesty
intellect, intimacy
effort, grace, peace
```


[02/14/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
that looks more like a tank now that i drew it


[02/14/2026 06:32] thesewhitelights
same words, different order


[02/14/2026 06:32] thesewhitelights
not that I memorized them


[02/14/2026 06:32] thesewhitelights
why would I


[02/14/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
what order do you want them in


[02/14/2026 06:32] thesewhitelights
The order isn't important now that I know the order isn't important


[02/14/2026 06:33] wintersloop_49457
oh ok, i'm extremely happy that you memorized them anyways


[02/14/2026 06:34] thesewhitelights
Not creepy?


[02/14/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
it's not stalking if we're both doing it


[02/14/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
(that's a joke)


[02/14/2026 06:35] thesewhitelights
(I laughed)


[02/14/2026 06:35] thesewhitelights
(enough to disrupt Ted)


[02/14/2026 06:35] wintersloop_49457
Ted! i get to meet him tomorrow too which is fun


[02/14/2026 06:36] thesewhitelights
Yes you will


[02/14/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
My presence will scratch your back


[02/14/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
Tonight


[02/14/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
If you're looking for company


[02/14/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
i just actually got goosebumps in anticipation


[02/14/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
that's wild


[02/14/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
i think they call this chemistry


[02/14/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
i'm always looking for your company


[02/14/2026 06:38] thesewhitelights
reactions


[02/14/2026 06:38] thesewhitelights
science


[02/14/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
every night


[02/14/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
I'm here now


[02/14/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
and I'm there now


[02/14/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
you are here and i am there


[02/14/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
do you like phone sex, or chatting about it? i have not done that in 20 years maybe, i'm asking because the tension feels really heavy whenever we do this


[02/14/2026 06:42] wintersloop_49457
i can't tell if you are thinking the same thing, although historically it would be a safe bet


[02/14/2026 06:43] thesewhitelights
whenever we do this = exist


[02/14/2026 06:43] wintersloop_49457
yes, haha


[02/14/2026 06:44] thesewhitelights
I could not say if I like phone sex because that's not a thing that's been a part of my experience, but I don't have an issues talking about it


[02/14/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
ok we can try sometime, i feel comfortable saying pretty much whatever to you it's just a delicate boundary to try and navigate without being able to see you


[02/14/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
so i don't know how to do it, but we can gently try?


[02/14/2026 06:46] thesewhitelights
that seems like a very us approach


[02/14/2026 06:46] thesewhitelights
because there's an us way to do things now it seems


[02/14/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
well the funny thing is though


[02/14/2026 06:47] wintersloop_49457
it was your way, and my way, before we met


[02/14/2026 06:47] thesewhitelights
so we do already know what we're doing


[02/14/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
yes, i mean, so the thing that is really crazy to me is how accurately i can model you already


[02/14/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
and i think it's because it's how i would behave


[02/14/2026 06:49] wintersloop_49457
have you ever heard the thing that people are only about 50% accurate in picking up on how someone is feeling, even when talking to them and stuff


[02/14/2026 06:49] thesewhitelights
I hadn't heard that statistic


[02/14/2026 06:50] wintersloop_49457
emphatic accuracy


[02/14/2026 06:50] wintersloop_49457
is generally measured about 50%


[02/14/2026 06:50] wintersloop_49457
that doesn't mean coinflip exactly, because there are many more than two ways for a person to feel


[02/14/2026 06:51] wintersloop_49457
but my point is that it seems like the number we have between us is *waaaaay* higher


[02/14/2026 06:51] thesewhitelights
Is that unnerving?


[02/14/2026 06:51] wintersloop_49457
crazily high considering we haven't even seen one another, and only known one another for this short period of time, the only real explanation is just that we think the same way, i can model you by just imagining myself and how i would feel


[02/14/2026 06:52] wintersloop_49457
which is what most people do anyways, but it doesn't usually work more than half the time


[02/14/2026 06:53] wintersloop_49457
i don't think unnerving, because that feels like a completely plausible explanation to me


[02/14/2026 06:54] thesewhitelights
The explanation being we're somehow similiar


[02/14/2026 06:54] wintersloop_49457
the unnerving parts are things like enjoying the sensations of being hot and cold, i have never met anyone who agreed with me


[02/14/2026 06:54] wintersloop_49457
and then we go down a list of ways i think i am unique and you have the same characteristics? that's


[02/14/2026 06:54] wintersloop_49457
i don't have words


[02/14/2026 06:55] thesewhitelights
I've been told my shape is too peculiar


[02/14/2026 06:55] thesewhitelights
But we fit


[02/14/2026 06:55] thesewhitelights
Snuggly


[02/14/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 06:56] thesewhitelights
I'm appreciating this thread of conversation because it confirms that I'm not losing my mind


[02/14/2026 06:56] wintersloop_49457
no you're not


[02/14/2026 06:56] wintersloop_49457
or, or, now hear me out


[02/14/2026 06:56] wintersloop_49457
we have both already lost our minds


[02/14/2026 06:57] thesewhitelights
In the same way!


[02/14/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
yes!


[02/14/2026 06:57] thesewhitelights
Add that to the Venn


[02/14/2026 06:57] wintersloop_49457
haha ok


[02/14/2026 06:57] thesewhitelights
You were going to go to sleep


[02/14/2026 06:58] wintersloop_49457
it's also so weird to hear myself say things like "i feel comfortable saying pretty much whatever to you" as if you're my longtime friend


[02/14/2026 06:58] wintersloop_49457
and we have 10 years under our belts or whatever


[02/14/2026 06:58] wintersloop_49457
but that is how i feel


[02/14/2026 06:58] thesewhitelights
When you tell your friends, what will they say?


[02/14/2026 06:59] wintersloop_49457
hm, that is a good question


[02/14/2026 06:59] wintersloop_49457
i think they will just welcome you


[02/14/2026 06:59] thesewhitelights
They will not try to take your temperature with the back of their hands to check to see if you're ill?


[02/14/2026 07:00] wintersloop_49457
idk actually


[02/14/2026 07:00] wintersloop_49457
one thing i can say is that we don't have a label which gives everything a lot of flexibility


[02/14/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
so explaining to someone that you are amy and you are awesome, and that's all that really matters, i think it circumvents a lot of consternation


[02/14/2026 07:01] thesewhitelights
I wasn't worried


[02/14/2026 07:02] thesewhitelights
Just curious


[02/14/2026 07:02] thesewhitelights
Always curious


[02/14/2026 07:02] thesewhitelights
About how things work


[02/14/2026 07:02] wintersloop_49457
it's a good question i had not considered


[02/14/2026 07:02] wintersloop_49457
sometime in our late 20s ari and beth and i developed an informal rule amongst our friend group


[02/14/2026 07:03] wintersloop_49457
that was basically like, don't bring you SO to group functions until you've been dating for at least a month


[02/14/2026 07:03] thesewhitelights
that seems very reasonable


[02/14/2026 07:03] wintersloop_49457
yeah, so


[02/14/2026 07:03] wintersloop_49457
we are still early for my friends to ask


[02/14/2026 07:04] thesewhitelights
I laughed


[02/14/2026 07:04] wintersloop_49457
because technically we have been dating for zero days


[02/14/2026 07:05] thesewhitelights
yes


[02/14/2026 07:05] wintersloop_49457
this part is new to me so you may have to guide me and give me hints


[02/14/2026 07:06] thesewhitelights
which part


[02/14/2026 07:06] wintersloop_49457
the not immediately categorizing and planning things out part, not asking you what we are, etc


[02/14/2026 07:07] thesewhitelights
This is new because that is what you usually do?


[02/14/2026 07:08] wintersloop_49457
well, kinda


[02/14/2026 07:08] wintersloop_49457
i would not ask for committment, but usally some kind of conversation to check that that's he trajectory we would like to follow


[02/14/2026 07:08] wintersloop_49457
in all situations i think moving slow is good


[02/14/2026 07:09] wintersloop_49457
i don't need anything from you that you're not already giving me


[02/14/2026 07:09] wintersloop_49457
and that's not the perspective i would normally take, i would normally start planning


[02/14/2026 07:10] thesewhitelights
I understand


[02/14/2026 07:10] thesewhitelights
Thanks for explaining


[02/14/2026 07:10] thesewhitelights
I really appreciate your willingness to do that


[02/14/2026 07:10] wintersloop_49457
ok, so you will have to give me hints sometimes


[02/14/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457
that is my request


[02/14/2026 07:11] thesewhitelights
hints


[02/14/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 07:11] thesewhitelights
I will do my best


[02/14/2026 07:12] wintersloop_49457
if i overstep something?


[02/14/2026 07:12] wintersloop_49457
i can be incredibly stupid, you will come to find


[02/14/2026 07:12] thesewhitelights
Oh!  I'm not worried about that at all


[02/14/2026 07:12] wintersloop_49457
oh ok, great, maybe i am just worrying for nothing then


[02/14/2026 07:13] thesewhitelights
You're worrying because you care


[02/14/2026 07:13] thesewhitelights
Keep the care, ditch the worry in this case

{Reactions}
💯

[02/14/2026 07:13] wintersloop_49457
yeah, i just want to respect what you need, that's my motivation


[02/14/2026 07:13] thesewhitelights
Yes, and you understand that's fully recipricated


[02/14/2026 07:13] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 07:15] wintersloop_49457
although, have you ever looked up various definitions of the word "care"


[02/14/2026 07:15] thesewhitelights
not specifically


[02/14/2026 07:15] wintersloop_49457

well let's not do that one please


[02/14/2026 07:16] wintersloop_49457
lol i know


[02/14/2026 07:16] wintersloop_49457
we need a different word


[02/14/2026 07:16] thesewhitelights
We'll find one


[02/14/2026 07:18] wintersloop_49457
all the best words have advanced levels of romantic connotation i think


[02/14/2026 07:19] thesewhitelights

why do they get to stake claim?


[02/14/2026 07:20] wintersloop_49457
well i more was thinking that while they may not own the term, they will certainly pop into my mind every time i try to tell you i care about you


[02/14/2026 07:21] thesewhitelights
Perfect!


[02/14/2026 07:21] wintersloop_49457
haha do you like it? if this pleases you we can use it


[02/14/2026 07:21] thesewhitelights
I think a few of them could use the royalties


[02/14/2026 07:22] thesewhitelights
Oh, I don't actually want to put that curse on you


[02/14/2026 07:22] wintersloop_49457
haha i bet


[02/14/2026 07:22] wintersloop_49457
you matter to me, i'm attuned to you


[02/14/2026 07:23] wintersloop_49457
i think the most honest expression, according to how i experience this, is "i listen for how you feel"

[02/14/2026 07:24] wintersloop_49457
that also feels just weird enough to be ours


[02/14/2026 07:24] wintersloop_49457
does it seem awkward or just a thing to get used to


[02/14/2026 07:25] thesewhitelights
the phrase?  it's the most accurate, but it's also a mouthful


[02/14/2026 07:26] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 07:26] thesewhitelights
Now I'm thinking about your mouth


[02/14/2026 07:26] wintersloop_49457
it is all yours


[02/14/2026 07:26] thesewhitelights
Well


[02/14/2026 07:26] thesewhitelights
It is very far away

at realizing what it will be like to kiss you, i don't know why i hadn't directly tried to picture that yet


[02/14/2026 07:29] thesewhitelights
I have been actively trying to avoid imagining it


[02/14/2026 07:29] wintersloop_49457
do you like my beard?


[02/14/2026 07:29] thesewhitelights
I like your beard


[02/14/2026 07:30] thesewhitelights
Or not beard


[02/14/2026 07:30] thesewhitelights
All of the things that are you

haha, i like beard, but it can be trimmed to a length of your preference is what i am saying, if it gets taken completely off i don't feel like the same person


[02/14/2026 07:30] thesewhitelights
Please don't take it off then

this song has popped into my head like 10 times this week


[02/14/2026 07:33] wintersloop_49457
i don't even like usher


[02/14/2026 07:33] thesewhitelights
I remember this video


[02/14/2026 07:33] thesewhitelights
The way Usher moves makes me laugh


[02/14/2026 07:34] thesewhitelights
It's very impressive, but there is a specific quality to it that makes me giggle


[02/14/2026 07:34] thesewhitelights
I pay very close attention to the way people move


[02/14/2026 07:34] wintersloop_49457
ok well you're going to have a field day with me

I'm not sure what you mean by that


[02/14/2026 07:36] wintersloop_49457
i have a sort of unique gait, i fidget, i sit awkwardly, somehow i actually have excellent balance, but it looks like i don't


[02/14/2026 07:36] wintersloop_49457
when i was at nowait i bet the CEO $500 i could walk across the office on my hands and he took the bet immediately, after i did it he sad "i have to be honest, i really thought you could barely walk on your legs"


[02/14/2026 07:37] thesewhitelights
I hope you don't hate my laugh


[02/14/2026 07:37] wintersloop_49457
not possible


[02/14/2026 07:37] thesewhitelights
Possible


[02/14/2026 07:38] wintersloop_49457
not really, at this point i'm going like everything because it's yours, and i know you


[02/14/2026 07:38] wintersloop_49457
but i'm betting it's going to be even better than that and you just genuinely have a nice voice and laugh and shape and everything


[02/14/2026 07:38] wintersloop_49457
if i had to put money on it


[02/14/2026 07:39] thesewhitelights
You don't have to put money on it


[02/14/2026 07:39] thesewhitelights
You were going to go to sleep


[02/14/2026 07:40] wintersloop_49457
ok i won't put money on it


[02/14/2026 07:40] wintersloop_49457
i do have to sleep, at least we didn't lie tonight


[02/14/2026 07:40] wintersloop_49457
we knew better


[02/14/2026 07:41] wintersloop_49457
are you going to sleep?


[02/14/2026 07:41] thesewhitelights
I'm 87% asleep already


[02/14/2026 07:41] wintersloop_49457
i'm listening to usher explain to me what's going on here


[02/14/2026 07:41] thesewhitelights
at least


[02/14/2026 07:41] wintersloop_49457
i gotta rewrite these lyrics


[02/14/2026 07:42] wintersloop_49457
god damn what a good project


[02/14/2026 07:42] wintersloop_49457
and then we can terribly sing it together

yessss


[02/14/2026 13:47] wintersloop_49457
you were all over my dreams


[02/14/2026 13:47] thesewhitelights
what did we do?


[02/14/2026 13:48] wintersloop_49457
🫢


[02/14/2026 13:48] wintersloop_49457
i will tell you but it's scandalous


[02/14/2026 13:48] thesewhitelights
did we eat dessert before dinner?


[02/14/2026 13:49] wintersloop_49457
yes actually that is a great way to describe what we did


[02/14/2026 13:49] wintersloop_49457
you were riding my face


[02/14/2026 13:50] wintersloop_49457
also at some point i wanted to take a bath with you but couldn't so we got a heated pool installed


[02/14/2026 13:51] thesewhitelights
I like your imagination


[02/14/2026 13:51] wintersloop_49457
also you made pumpernickel toast


[02/14/2026 13:51] wintersloop_49457
for me


[02/14/2026 13:51] wintersloop_49457
i don't really like pumpernickel but i ate it


[02/14/2026 13:51] thesewhitelights
with butter or cream cheese?


[02/14/2026 13:52] wintersloop_49457
ok i don't think it was like that i think it was toast with tomatoes


[02/14/2026 13:52] thesewhitelights
hmmm, I wonder where that image came from


[02/14/2026 13:52] wintersloop_49457
no idea


[02/14/2026 13:53] thesewhitelights
what strange and unusual and unexpected things for you to dream about


[02/14/2026 13:54] thesewhitelights
I hope they were good dreams even if the toast was not the best


[02/14/2026 13:54] wintersloop_49457
no it was the best because you made it


[02/14/2026 13:55] thesewhitelights
In real life I will make you toast that you like because you will tell me pumpernickel is not your favorite


[02/14/2026 13:55] wintersloop_49457
ok yay


[02/14/2026 13:56] thesewhitelights
Did you get enough sleep?


[02/14/2026 13:56] wintersloop_49457
well i got twice as much sleep as i have been getting


[02/14/2026 13:56] wintersloop_49457
probably not enough


[02/14/2026 13:56] wintersloop_49457
i will maybe nap later


[02/14/2026 13:57] wintersloop_49457
how do you feel?


[02/14/2026 13:58] wintersloop_49457
also i think we should just say "i'm still listening"


[02/14/2026 13:58] thesewhitelights

it's much easier to do if i sleep, it turns out


[02/14/2026 14:00] thesewhitelights
I wish I had slept more, my body and brain say I need more sleep, but I think I will manage just fine


[02/14/2026 14:00] thesewhitelights
I had been wondering about that this morning, actually


[02/14/2026 14:00] thesewhitelights
what we are like when we're both in easier positions than we have been this past week


[02/14/2026 14:01] wintersloop_49457
do you think it will be different?


[02/14/2026 14:02] wintersloop_49457
i wasn't using you as escape, you took up the whole room


[02/14/2026 14:02] thesewhitelights
I didn't mean to intrude!


[02/14/2026 14:02] wintersloop_49457
haha you couldn't have done otherwise


[02/14/2026 14:02] wintersloop_49457
all you had to do was say hi this is me


[02/14/2026 14:03] thesewhitelights
that's what I was supposed to do, right?  to start a reddit chat?  "Hey what's up, lol.  You sound hot, and I'm bored.  Entertain me"


[02/14/2026 14:04] wintersloop_49457
haha is that what this is


[02/14/2026 14:04] wintersloop_49457
i should have known


[02/14/2026 14:05] thesewhitelights
I'm told those are the conventions of reddit chats, which is something I was pondering as I wrote a story about a righteous rebellion


[02/14/2026 14:06] thesewhitelights
"I will tell this man why I played the tuba, and he will then know me"


[02/14/2026 14:06] thesewhitelights
"and then he can decide"


[02/14/2026 14:07] wintersloop_49457
it was a really good story


[02/14/2026 14:07] thesewhitelights
I wanted you to know what you were getting into if you responded


[02/14/2026 14:08] wintersloop_49457
well here we are


[02/14/2026 14:08] thesewhitelights
I hated playing the tuba, by the way.  And I wasn't very effective at it because I didn't have the lung capacity to carry that weight


[02/14/2026 14:09] wintersloop_49457
but you did it, and you had that story as a result


[02/14/2026 14:10] thesewhitelights
And I inspired another girl to play the tuba.  She went on to join an orchestra.  I take no credit for her accomplishments (and half suspect she might have been interested in it because I was the only woman in the concert band who was allowed to wear pants)


[02/14/2026 14:10] wintersloop_49457
oh happy valentines day btw  💘


[02/14/2026 14:10] thesewhitelights

[02/14/2026 14:12] thesewhitelights
The skirts the other women had to wear were long and thick and scratchy and uncomfortable.  They were required to wear heels.  I was very pleased to be strutting around in my tux pants and combat boots

[02/14/2026 14:13] thesewhitelights
And by strutting around I mean lugging that behemoth behind me


[02/14/2026 14:14] thesewhitelights
Hilariously, the other tuba player was a large man who played football


[02/14/2026 14:14] thesewhitelights
He made the instrument look small


[02/14/2026 14:14] thesewhitelights
We were quite the pair


[02/14/2026 14:14] wintersloop_49457
haha that is a good picture


[02/14/2026 14:16] thesewhitelights
Are you still in bed?


[02/14/2026 14:16] wintersloop_49457
yeah


[02/14/2026 14:17] thesewhitelights
That is a good picture


[02/14/2026 14:17] wintersloop_49457
i'm glad you think so


[02/14/2026 14:17] wintersloop_49457
i'm very happy in bed generally


[02/14/2026 14:18] wintersloop_49457
we could make a bed so happy

{Reactions}
💯

[02/14/2026 14:18] thesewhitelights
Does that mean when you're in bed you feel relaxed and content and happy, or does that mean you like being in bed, or both?


[02/14/2026 14:18] wintersloop_49457
both


[02/14/2026 14:19] wintersloop_49457
i do a good job of keeping the bed for only relaxing and sleeping


[02/14/2026 14:19] wintersloop_49457
on the mornings when i get up stressed, that is part of the issue, i don't want to linger in the bed while i'm stressed out


[02/14/2026 14:19] wintersloop_49457
that's not the place for it


[02/14/2026 14:20] thesewhitelights
I unfortunately have not had that luxury, but now that I'm not in with brain pain a significant portion of my time, I have come to really really like the goodness of being in bed


[02/14/2026 14:21] wintersloop_49457
maybe starting monday we can rebuild you a safe bedspace


[02/14/2026 14:21] thesewhitelights
Safe


[02/14/2026 14:21] thesewhitelights
Bed is already a good place for me


[02/14/2026 14:22] thesewhitelights
Safe is something else


[02/14/2026 14:22] wintersloop_49457
it's hard because you were hurt?


[02/14/2026 14:25] thesewhitelights
I think the best explanation is I've had to watch my own back for most of my life, and sleep becomes vulnerable when there is no one else to tend the fires and watch for the lions that are lurking around in the darkness.  I'm a light sleeper for the sake of preservation, but there have been times when I've been grateful for it.


[02/14/2026 14:26] wintersloop_49457
okay, i'm sorry it feels like that


[02/14/2026 14:26] thesewhitelights
I get much better sleep these days


[02/14/2026 14:26] wintersloop_49457
someday i hope i can put myself in between you and the door


[02/14/2026 14:27] thesewhitelights
You already have many, many, many times.  Many more than you know.


[02/14/2026 14:27] thesewhitelights
And I have slept like the dead


[02/14/2026 14:27] wintersloop_49457
oh, thank you for letting me know that


[02/14/2026 14:27] wintersloop_49457
it feels good


[02/14/2026 14:31] thesewhitelights
It does feel good, and thank you for your service that you didn't know you were providing


[02/14/2026 14:32] wintersloop_49457
since that first morning you told me that your sleep doesn't work when the migraines are bad, i have had the wish i could do something to make sleep easier for you but it seemed not possible


[02/14/2026 14:32] wintersloop_49457
it's a great feeling


[02/14/2026 14:35] thesewhitelights
I'm a good problem-solver, and when I'd have trouble sleeping from headaches or the rest of life, I would ask myself what would help.  The help I identified was eerily shaped like your presence.  That's not a pressure statement.  Just a coincidence.


[02/14/2026 14:36] wintersloop_49457
ok well you can have him whenever you want


[02/14/2026 14:36] wintersloop_49457
but it sounds like you guys already know one another


[02/14/2026 14:37] thesewhitelights
It's so very nice of you to join us


[02/14/2026 14:39] wintersloop_49457
speaking of which


[02/14/2026 14:40] wintersloop_49457
i want to invite you to board games night, how do you feel about that


[02/14/2026 14:41] thesewhitelights
tell me more about it


[02/14/2026 14:41] wintersloop_49457
it's me and a few friends, basically just my closest friends


[02/14/2026 14:41] wintersloop_49457
we get on discord and we play jackbox games


[02/14/2026 14:42] wintersloop_49457
i don't think i explained what those games are to you thoroughly, just mentioned them?


[02/14/2026 14:42] thesewhitelights
I remember from them from the lockdowns


[02/14/2026 14:42] wintersloop_49457
oh ok cool, so you know this already


[02/14/2026 14:43] thesewhitelights
I never played them but I remember it was a thing that people did


[02/14/2026 14:43] wintersloop_49457
trivia is the easiest to explain, it's trivia and you get points


[02/14/2026 14:43] wintersloop_49457
next


[02/14/2026 14:44] wintersloop_49457
there is a game called guesspionage where each person takes turns and they are asked questions like "What percentage of people have finished a marathon, start to finish?"


[02/14/2026 14:44] wintersloop_49457
and you have a little circular slider that you slide to set a percentage


[02/14/2026 14:45] wintersloop_49457
and then everyone else guesses if you were high or low


[02/14/2026 14:46] wintersloop_49457
then there are games like champ'd up where everyone is given a prompt like "the champion of embarrassment", and you are supposed to draw a character that will "fight" against everyon else's champion


[02/14/2026 14:46] wintersloop_49457
then they put the champions head to head in different described scenarios and everyone votes on which champion would win


[02/14/2026 14:47] thesewhitelights
When do these games happen


[02/14/2026 14:48] wintersloop_49457
we have to play calendar tetris gerrymandering


[02/14/2026 14:49] wintersloop_49457
not regularly scheduled


[02/14/2026 14:49] wintersloop_49457
probably within two weeks


[02/14/2026 14:50] thesewhitelights
Am I allowed to join as someone who very much wants to kiss your face?


[02/14/2026 14:50] wintersloop_49457
yeah of course


[02/14/2026 14:52] wintersloop_49457
i am really grateful that you exist and really grateful you want to kiss me


[02/14/2026 14:52] wintersloop_49457
and they are going to know that


[02/14/2026 14:53] thesewhitelights
I'm strongly considering this invitation


[02/14/2026 14:53] wintersloop_49457
you can skip the first one, i will not be upset


[02/14/2026 14:53] wintersloop_49457
or even the second


[02/14/2026 14:53] thesewhitelights
Normally, I don't play the games right away on game nights if I don't know the people or the games


[02/14/2026 14:53] thesewhitelights
I love love love watching


[02/14/2026 14:54] wintersloop_49457
ohhh, well we could be a "team"


[02/14/2026 14:54] wintersloop_49457
meaning you just won't play haha


[02/14/2026 14:54] thesewhitelights
hahaha


[02/14/2026 14:54] wintersloop_49457
and tell me what to do secretly


[02/14/2026 14:54] wintersloop_49457
normally the team would be colocated


[02/14/2026 14:54] wintersloop_49457
but we don't have this option


[02/14/2026 14:55] thesewhitelights

I'm in


[02/14/2026 14:57] thesewhitelights
Not this time but in the future


[02/14/2026 14:57] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 14:59] thesewhitelights

[02/14/2026 15:00] wintersloop_49457
i like you


[02/14/2026 15:00] thesewhitelights
Yay!


[02/14/2026 15:01] thesewhitelights
When you nap, do you stretch out on the couch or strip and get back in bed?


[02/14/2026 15:02] wintersloop_49457
usually couch, sometimes bed


[02/14/2026 15:02] wintersloop_49457
my couch is pretty excellent though


[02/14/2026 15:02] wintersloop_49457
there is room for two


[02/14/2026 15:03] thesewhitelights
Noted.


[02/14/2026 15:05] thesewhitelights
I'm very glad I responded to your post.


[02/14/2026 15:05] thesewhitelights
That comment is unrelated to you having a large couch.


[02/14/2026 15:05] thesewhitelights
But not unrelated to you wanting to tell me tha tyou have a large couch.


[02/14/2026 15:10] wintersloop_49457
i don't know what to do with all of the feelings other than just keep telling you


[02/14/2026 15:11] thesewhitelights
I can relate


[02/14/2026 15:12] wintersloop_49457
monday mike gave up btw


[02/14/2026 15:15] thesewhitelights
He has decided it is perfectly reasonable for you to have these feelings for one of the many dozens of women who responded to the post he planned on posting?


[02/14/2026 15:15] wintersloop_49457
i told him we're done posting


[02/14/2026 15:16] thesewhitelights
I am not sorry, Monday Mike


[02/14/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457
it wasn't even close


[02/14/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457
monday mike doesn't understand that it's possible for you to exist


[02/14/2026 15:22] thesewhitelights
Based on what he wrote in the posts, it sure sounded like he believed it was possible to find someone who fits


[02/14/2026 15:24] wintersloop_49457
i didn't tell you this at the time bc i thought you would think i was cray or something but i told fawn #2 i wasn't interested within hours of you asking me about that


[02/14/2026 15:26] thesewhitelights
I did wonder how it was possible for you to be carrying on conversations outside of this one considering all the time and attention I was stealing away


[02/14/2026 15:26] wintersloop_49457
when you asked for the slient minute


[02/14/2026 15:27] wintersloop_49457
i started feeling guilty about talking to her, and i know you never said anything like that, and you are reasonable and not trying to force anything, etc, but it's how i felt


[02/14/2026 15:29] thesewhitelights
I felt guilty talking to you so much and taking you away from what you were doing


[02/14/2026 15:29] wintersloop_49457
no you shouldn't, i'm doing it with my eyes open


[02/14/2026 15:30] wintersloop_49457
i do agree i need to rebalance my week a little bit better because i can't do this forever but i do want to give you a lot of time


[02/14/2026 15:30] thesewhitelights
Oh very much so

[02/14/2026 15:32] thesewhitelights
Maybe it's not a fair ask, but I'm asking anyway:  if our roles were reversed, would you have felt guilty getting my attention if you knew I had a fawn #2 or 20?


[02/14/2026 15:33] wintersloop_49457
not guilty, to me that is anxiety provoking, i can't do compersion very well but i do try


[02/14/2026 15:33] wintersloop_49457
i would not have said that to you though


[02/14/2026 15:33] wintersloop_49457
i would have just said that i want you to be happy, which is true


[02/14/2026 15:34] wintersloop_49457
romantic compersion*


[02/14/2026 15:35] wintersloop_49457
by itself i'm great at it


[02/14/2026 15:35] thesewhitelights
Thank you for explaining


[02/14/2026 15:36] wintersloop_49457
i do really believe that one of the best ways to think about a relationship is that you have to choose one another every day


[02/14/2026 15:36] thesewhitelights
Just to clear:  There is no fawn #2 or 20, and there is definitely to comparison.


[02/14/2026 15:37] thesewhitelights
I don't have my glasses on and read that quickly, and I misread it as the best way to think about a relationshp is that you have to choose one every other day


[02/14/2026 15:37] wintersloop_49457
lol


[02/14/2026 15:38] wintersloop_49457
well, we have not made any commitments, and i would not be mad if you did, but from what i can tell neither of us wants to, which is what i'm saying it's supposed to be

(neither wants to search for another fawn)


[02/14/2026 15:43] thesewhitelights
If it's helpful, and you don't need to even acknowledge this information because I just thought you might appreciate having it, I can confirm I have zero interest in any sort of searching.  I didn't have interest in it before you magically showed up while I was sitting on my couch minding my own business, and I keep laughing, like a good belly laugh, whenever I think about it being something I'd consider doing now


[02/14/2026 15:44] wintersloop_49457
yes, it's helpful for anxiety purposes but those are also sort-of unhealthy possessive feelings that i work to try and unwind


[02/14/2026 15:44] thesewhitelights
It's just not how I function and now how I approach life


[02/14/2026 15:45] thesewhitelights
I understand


[02/14/2026 15:45] wintersloop_49457
the prevailing feeling should be that you do whatever you want, not what i want. you see why it's not good to feel that way?


[02/14/2026 15:45] wintersloop_49457
i mean it is romantic, and it shows i'm still listening, but it's not always good


[02/14/2026 15:46] thesewhitelights
I completely understand


[02/14/2026 15:46] wintersloop_49457
okay good


[02/14/2026 15:47] thesewhitelights
I'm not saying you showed up and took the choice way from me.  That's not how I feel.  I'm just letting you know that I choose you.


[02/14/2026 15:48] wintersloop_49457
i choose you


[02/14/2026 15:48] wintersloop_49457
i literally have nowhere to put this joy


[02/14/2026 15:48] wintersloop_49457
it's a lot


[02/14/2026 15:49] thesewhitelights
Laughing helps


[02/14/2026 15:50] thesewhitelights
And I'm very happy


[02/14/2026 15:50] thesewhitelights
I do feel bad that you felt guilty, but I'm going to let that go


[02/14/2026 15:50] wintersloop_49457
i'm not surprised it happened, this is mostly why i hate online dating


[02/14/2026 15:51] wintersloop_49457
i can't feel deeply for more than one person at a time


[02/14/2026 15:51] wintersloop_49457
and if i was going to try i would want them to know about one another


[02/14/2026 15:51] thesewhitelights
You told me


[02/14/2026 15:51] thesewhitelights
I said I was supportive


[02/14/2026 15:52] wintersloop_49457
ooh ok i don't remember having this convo


[02/14/2026 15:52] wintersloop_49457
which is surprising because that's an important detail about you to me


[02/14/2026 15:52] thesewhitelights
I probably should have been more direct


[02/14/2026 15:53] thesewhitelights
I'm sorry if I wasn't


[02/14/2026 15:53] wintersloop_49457
maybe i had not yet learned to listen to you


[02/14/2026 15:53] wintersloop_49457
i like how you communicate you don't have to change anything, or be sorry


[02/14/2026 15:54] thesewhitelights
I think I know what happened


[02/14/2026 15:56] thesewhitelights
I laughed at your usage of the word "fawning" because I thought it was absolutely delightful but didn't explain that reason right away, and you were second guessing your usage and might have missed the part when I said "go get'm tiger" in more eloquent words


[02/14/2026 15:57] wintersloop_49457
haha yeah i must have, i don't remember that


[02/14/2026 15:57] wintersloop_49457
i don't think you could have said anything to make me feel any differently


[02/14/2026 15:58] thesewhitelights
it has passed and is not important now, but I was very intentional about not putting you in a position where you might feel bad for doing whatever it was that you wanted to do


[02/14/2026 15:58] wintersloop_49457
there's too much going on here, and it was rapidly apparent there was a lot going on, and i wasn't sure that it was going to actually work out, but i knew that every other conversation was not fulfilling in comparison, so it was just a thing i needed to do


[02/14/2026 15:58] thesewhitelights
I appreciate that


[02/14/2026 15:59] thesewhitelights
It was something I recognized to and recognize it might be putting a wrench in Monday Mike's plans


[02/14/2026 15:59] wintersloop_49457
it also highlighted how performative, game-like a lot of interactions i have with people are


[02/14/2026 16:00] wintersloop_49457
not intentionally


[02/14/2026 16:00] wintersloop_49457
but it's really noticeable when i don't have to try to be any certain way and just talk to you


[02/14/2026 16:01] thesewhitelights
I have been wondering about that


[02/14/2026 16:01] thesewhitelights
Because your approach was different in the beginning


[02/14/2026 16:01] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 16:01] thesewhitelights
You were doing the thing, and I didn't know how to do the thing


[02/14/2026 16:01] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/14/2026 16:01] thesewhitelights
So I wasn't sure if you'd stick around


[02/14/2026 16:01] thesewhitelights
But then the thing wasn't happening anymore

{Reactions}
🙌🏻 🙏🏻

[02/14/2026 16:03] thesewhitelights
Thanks for trusting me


[02/14/2026 16:04] wintersloop_49457
thank you too


[02/14/2026 16:05] thesewhitelights
Are you still in bed?


[02/14/2026 16:06] wintersloop_49457
no i am in my kitchen making it look less like


[02/14/2026 16:06] wintersloop_49457
i don't even know what to call it


[02/14/2026 16:06] wintersloop_49457
a frat house if they mainly ate spinach and chicken


[02/14/2026 16:07] thesewhitelights
I love this so much.


[02/14/2026 16:07] thesewhitelights
Also, you may be surprised by how many frat boys eat a lot of spinach and chicken


[02/14/2026 16:07] wintersloop_49457
this is not my recollection


[02/14/2026 16:07] wintersloop_49457
i pledged DU and i think the diet was like pabst and eggs


[02/14/2026 16:08] thesewhitelights
I taught mostly first-year students, so I learned A LOT about the other side of frat boys because I am magical and they felt safe and like full humans in my office


[02/14/2026 16:08] wintersloop_49457
that's so nice


[02/14/2026 16:08] wintersloop_49457
i think my brothers could have used your help


[02/14/2026 16:08] wintersloop_49457
actually, at that age, i could have used your help


[02/14/2026 16:09] thesewhitelights
Some of them were maybe a little toooo comfortable, but nothing that crossed any lines I was uncomfortable with


[02/14/2026 16:09] wintersloop_49457
that is pretty common though, no?


[02/14/2026 16:09] wintersloop_49457
i had an excellent therapist in my 20s who taught me a ton about myself and, given how i form attraction to people, i felt attracted to her


[02/14/2026 16:10] wintersloop_49457
i was not rude enough to show that to her though


[02/14/2026 16:10] thesewhitelights
Oh, no, those situations were rare


[02/14/2026 16:10] thesewhitelights
Like they weren't flirting with me


[02/14/2026 16:11] thesewhitelights
Well


[02/14/2026 16:11] thesewhitelights
No


[02/14/2026 16:11] thesewhitelights
We'll go with they weren't flirting with me


[02/14/2026 16:11] thesewhitelights
It was more they felt safe and then let it all hang out


[02/14/2026 16:11] thesewhitelights
Sometimes literally


[02/14/2026 16:11] wintersloop_49457
lol


[02/14/2026 16:13] thesewhitelights
I did have an organized fan club, but I usually pretend like I don't know that and I'm not sure why I'm telling you that except it's you and I tell you all of the things


[02/14/2026 16:13] wintersloop_49457
that doesn't surprise me even a little


[02/14/2026 16:14] wintersloop_49457
where do i sign up


[02/14/2026 16:14] thesewhitelights
Apparently in the animation lab


[02/14/2026 16:14] thesewhitelights
if memory serves


[02/14/2026 16:17] thesewhitelights
Teenage hormones aside, I was a very, very, very good teacher.  You won't hear me boast about much, but I am comfortable acknowledging that.


[02/14/2026 16:18] wintersloop_49457
that's hot


[02/14/2026 16:18] wintersloop_49457
you should boast to me


[02/14/2026 16:18] wintersloop_49457
tell me what you are good at, i will always like it


[02/14/2026 16:19] wintersloop_49457
it will give me more reasons to celebrate you


[02/14/2026 16:20] thesewhitelights
I will


[02/14/2026 16:21] thesewhitelights
and trust you will do the same so I can do the same


[02/14/2026 16:21] wintersloop_49457
ok yes


[02/14/2026 16:22] wintersloop_49457
i have a hard time with this, so i need to explain to you


[02/14/2026 16:23] wintersloop_49457
in things that i'm good at, i am extremely hard on myself, and try to always find where i can grow. i tend to focus on what i'm bad at and attack those things and then over time i keep getting better


[02/14/2026 16:24] wintersloop_49457
sometimes when people compliment me it feels too much like "you've arrived" and that they don't understand i will never be as good as i want to be, i have to just keep trying


[02/14/2026 16:25] wintersloop_49457
so, i know, internally, that the key here is to try and view complements as checkpoints or milestones on the journey instead of someone declaring it complete


[02/14/2026 16:26] wintersloop_49457
the thing that i still struggle with is complimenting myself


[02/14/2026 16:26] thesewhitelights
we are going to be so very, very good for each other and so very, very good to each other


[02/14/2026 16:26] wintersloop_49457
yes i think so


[02/14/2026 16:27] wintersloop_49457
i'm still trying to calm myself down haha


[02/14/2026 16:27] wintersloop_49457
just go one day at a time and we will get to where we're going


[02/14/2026 16:28] thesewhitelights
When I thinking of giving compliments on accomplishments, it's always been, "YES! Go, go, go! Look at you go!"


[02/14/2026 16:28] thesewhitelights
Forward momentum


[02/14/2026 16:28] wintersloop_49457
yay


[02/14/2026 16:28] wintersloop_49457
you already get it


[02/14/2026 16:29] wintersloop_49457
i guess i should not be surprised, considering that there doesn't appear to be anything we don't understand about one another


[02/14/2026 16:29] thesewhitelights
That's just naturally how I'm wired


[02/14/2026 16:30] thesewhitelights
I regret to inform you I am reluctantly putting clothes on


[02/14/2026 16:30] wintersloop_49457
oh no


[02/14/2026 16:30] wintersloop_49457
i should have been asking you about your nakedness all morning


[02/14/2026 16:30] wintersloop_49457
see i told you i am dumb


[02/14/2026 16:30] thesewhitelights
I have been lounging in bed this entire time!  Which is surprising and a little hilarious to me


[02/14/2026 16:31] thesewhitelights
Why would you ask?  Not asking is not dumb

{Reactions}
🤔

[02/14/2026 16:32] wintersloop_49457
because i like it


[02/14/2026 16:32] thesewhitelights
I've honestly been naked for a significant portion of our togethered existence


[02/14/2026 16:32] wintersloop_49457
this is really good


[02/14/2026 16:33] thesewhitelights
Like I was already in bed when you accepted my chat request


[02/14/2026 16:34] thesewhitelights
And the picture I sent you to say the goodnight lie that one time?  Completely naked (which I thought you might have noticed but trusted you would know I was not sending it for the purpose of being scandalous)


[02/14/2026 16:34] wintersloop_49457
yeah i thought you were


[02/14/2026 16:34] wintersloop_49457
naked, not scandalous


[02/14/2026 16:34] thesewhitelights
were you scandalized?


[02/14/2026 16:35] wintersloop_49457
no i think we cutely broached sexual topics at just the right time


[02/14/2026 16:35] wintersloop_49457
and were good at building tension but focusing on not that at the start


[02/14/2026 16:36] thesewhitelights
I was sincerely asking for sleeping reasons when I asked if you wear pajamas!


[02/14/2026 16:37] thesewhitelights
Me: Sleeping naked is nice, does he sleep naked, does it feel nice to him?

You: Yes, I sleep naked and it is nice, also wiggle wiggle eyebrow wiggle


[02/14/2026 16:37] wintersloop_49457
haha noooo


[02/14/2026 16:37] wintersloop_49457
not the eyebrow wiggle


[02/14/2026 16:38] thesewhitelights
It was very endearing and exciting and I loved it


[02/14/2026 16:38] wintersloop_49457
ok good


[02/14/2026 16:39] wintersloop_49457
but also everything you do is endearing


[02/14/2026 16:40] thesewhitelights
I avoid making assumptions, so sometimes I need explicit explanation or confirmation of things.  Like when you said of course you enjoy thinking of me naked, that wasn't of the course in my mind because I wouldn't just assume that


[02/14/2026 16:41] wintersloop_49457
that's fair, i appreciate that actually, it's good of you


[02/14/2026 16:41] wintersloop_49457
it defies gender norms


[02/14/2026 16:42] thesewhitelights
Because most women expect men are thinking of them naked?


[02/14/2026 16:42] wintersloop_49457
in a romantic / flirting context, yes i think that's true


[02/14/2026 16:46] thesewhitelights
My body is great (I'm squishy in all of the right places), but you've been here for my brain

{Reactions}
🍑 🧠

[02/14/2026 16:46] wintersloop_49457
> She is naked. I am naked. We both sleep this way. We learned this about each other at two in the morning, in separate beds, in separate time zones, when she asked if I wore pajamas and then said Me too before I could think to ask. You can ignore my answer if you didn't want to know that. As if there were any universe in which I didn't want to know that.


[02/14/2026 16:47] wintersloop_49457
i'm still working on it but i already had that in there before we started this convo


[02/14/2026 16:47] wintersloop_49457
and yes i am here for your brain


[02/14/2026 16:49] thesewhitelights
Mmmm


[02/14/2026 16:52] wintersloop_49457
i should exercise


[02/14/2026 16:52] thesewhitelights
I should take a shower


[02/14/2026 16:52] wintersloop_49457
i will be thinking about you


[02/14/2026 16:52] thesewhitelights
Same


[02/14/2026 16:52] wintersloop_49457
why is it so hard to leave


[02/14/2026 16:52] thesewhitelights
It's not really leaving


[02/14/2026 16:53] wintersloop_49457
i know


[02/14/2026 16:53] wintersloop_49457
ok


[02/14/2026 16:53] wintersloop_49457
i'm still listening


[02/14/2026 16:53] wintersloop_49457
bye bye

I'm glad you like it! And don't mind the extra squiggly handwriting because I was excited and tired while writing


[02/14/2026 20:44] wintersloop_49457
no i love your handwriting


[02/14/2026 20:59] thesewhitelights
I will hang onto this until it can make it's way to you


[02/14/2026 20:59] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to print it out


[02/14/2026 21:00] wintersloop_49457
but out of there needing to be *some* semblance of internet safety yeah we shouldn't exchange addresses yet


[02/14/2026 21:02] thesewhitelights
I wasn't going to ask for your address because I figured if a day comes when we part ways and we haven't spent any time breathing the same air, a picture is probably enough of a memory if you need one

😢

[02/14/2026 21:03] wintersloop_49457
you are right


[02/14/2026 21:05] thesewhitelights
I'm looking forward to seeing your handwriting, but I'm not requesting it today because today I get to see you and that's... so good, and we'll do this one piece at a time because we have time


[02/14/2026 21:07] wintersloop_49457
yes we can dole out parts of ourselves over time like little treats


[02/14/2026 21:12] thesewhitelights
I just got home from brunch with my marathon runners.  My heart is full.  And this day will keep giving!


[02/14/2026 21:14] wintersloop_49457
oh i should tell you a sad thing about me, i can't run, really, i can run on an inclined treadmill, but anything else will bring back sciatica


[02/14/2026 21:14] thesewhitelights
Sad news?  This is welcomed news.  This means the bear will eat you first.


[02/14/2026 21:15] wintersloop_49457
i mean, i guess i always do like to be useful, especially to you


[02/14/2026 21:15] wintersloop_49457
i would make a good bear meal


[02/14/2026 21:15] wintersloop_49457
so useful to you *and* the bear


[02/14/2026 21:17] thesewhitelights
Isabel (runner) did ask what characteristics of yours I'm attracted to, and being considerate was at the top of the list


[02/14/2026 21:17] thesewhitelights
For the record, I do not run.  And I would punch a bear in the face before I'd let it eat you.

[02/14/2026 21:18] wintersloop_49457
ok what is the marathon running group then


[02/14/2026 21:19] thesewhitelights
My best friend, Renee, is a runner.  Her best running friend is Isabel.  They ran from their town to my town to have brunch with me.


[02/14/2026 21:21] wintersloop_49457
ohhhh ok


[02/14/2026 21:21] wintersloop_49457
i'm flattered you talked about me


[02/14/2026 21:21] thesewhitelights
They run.  I eat. 😊


[02/14/2026 21:21] wintersloop_49457
we are on the same page


[02/14/2026 21:25] thesewhitelights
They had many questions and were wondering how it's possible that Amy has a date, and that date is on Valentine's Day


[02/14/2026 21:25] wintersloop_49457
i keep asking myself this same question


[02/14/2026 21:26] wintersloop_49457
and how is it me?


[02/14/2026 21:26] wintersloop_49457
that can't be a real story


[02/14/2026 21:26] wintersloop_49457
so what was your explanation


[02/14/2026 21:29] thesewhitelights
Renee already knew and was maybe not thrilled about this development, and she had told Isabel.  Isabel brought it up while Renee was in the bathroom, and Isabel got very excited.  Renee was then infected by Isabel's excitement and came around like Monday Mike because she could clearly see I was much more than okay.


[02/14/2026 21:29] thesewhitelights
I told them we have been tossing words back and forth nonstop for days, and each day has been a lifetime.


[02/14/2026 21:30] wintersloop_49457
it's true


[02/14/2026 21:31] thesewhitelights
Very


[02/14/2026 21:32] wintersloop_49457
i added a word to wortschatz


[02/14/2026 21:32] wintersloop_49457
idk if you have seen that you can describe your own feelings and it will help you add words


[02/14/2026 21:33] thesewhitelights
Thank you.

[02/14/2026 21:34] wintersloop_49457
yes of course


[02/14/2026 21:34] thesewhitelights
Comments that don't come in words.


[02/14/2026 21:34] wintersloop_49457
so many from both of us


[02/14/2026 21:34] thesewhitelights
Not even words in wordschatz


[02/14/2026 21:34] wintersloop_49457
we are never going to run out


[02/14/2026 21:34] wintersloop_49457
not even words in wordschatz


[02/14/2026 21:36] thesewhitelights
I knew all 3 of the words that were used!


[02/14/2026 21:36] wintersloop_49457
i thought you might


[02/14/2026 21:37] wintersloop_49457
i need to go interact with other people in order to let some of it out because i have just been like smiling to myself for two days alone in my condo


[02/14/2026 21:37] thesewhitelights
I learned this morning that Isabel was born in Germany, and her parents are German professors (from Taiwan).  She left Germany when she was 7 and has lost a lot of the language, but Renee is insisting we try to speak to each other.  We both chickened out.


[02/14/2026 21:37] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to meet up with ari on sunday


[02/14/2026 21:37] wintersloop_49457
oh you mean all three of the roots


[02/14/2026 21:38] thesewhitelights
Yes, but also the feelings the wordschatz words describe


[02/14/2026 21:38] wintersloop_49457
A+, i need to do some more duolingo

I was going to dip the truffles this morning so I could deliver them at brunch, but then I laid in bed naked with you instead.  So, I'm going to dip truffles this afternoon to focus some of this excited energy.  These truffles are going to taste SO good with all of the Chromeo and affection that's being mixed into them.


[02/14/2026 21:40] wintersloop_49457
i get scared when i encounter french speakers as well, it's 50/50 whether or not i will go ahead and embarrass myself by trying


[02/14/2026 21:41] wintersloop_49457
i need to channel my joy into some more cleaning and probably i will go for a walk


[02/14/2026 21:47] thesewhitelights
I love walking.


[02/14/2026 21:47] wintersloop_49457
me too


[02/14/2026 21:47] thesewhitelights
Going on walks.


[02/14/2026 21:47] wintersloop_49457
left right


[02/14/2026 21:47] wintersloop_49457
left right


[02/14/2026 21:47] wintersloop_49457
do you do this while you walk in your head ever?


[02/14/2026 21:48] thesewhitelights
But also the ambulation


[02/14/2026 21:48] wintersloop_49457
as like a meditation


[02/14/2026 21:48] thesewhitelights
I count steps


[02/14/2026 21:48] wintersloop_49457
ahhh, i have not done that but i will try today


[02/14/2026 21:49] wintersloop_49457
what i do is i just try to feel the left/right over and over in a ryhthm and it's really similar to meditation, have you ever done vinyasa?


[02/14/2026 21:49] thesewhitelights
I have


[02/14/2026 21:49] wintersloop_49457
yes it's the same idea just easier


[02/14/2026 21:50] wintersloop_49457
it can help me not be upset if i'm upset about something


[02/14/2026 21:50] wintersloop_49457
usually though it is just there to make the day better


[02/14/2026 21:51] thesewhitelights
I like imagining you feeling relief


[02/14/2026 21:51] wintersloop_49457
me too, really


[02/14/2026 21:51] thesewhitelights
Like that moment you just described


[02/14/2026 21:51] wintersloop_49457
i get very happy when you tell me you are feeling better, woke up feeling good, etc


[02/14/2026 21:52] wintersloop_49457
actually it's not happy, it's my own relief, i think


[02/14/2026 21:52] thesewhitelights
I'm feeling fine today, by the way.  I realized during brunch that I hadn't told you yet


[02/14/2026 21:52] wintersloop_49457
ok good


[02/14/2026 21:53] thesewhitelights
If brain pain were a fever, it would just be 99 degrees


[02/14/2026 21:54] wintersloop_49457
ok, not so bad


[02/14/2026 21:55] wintersloop_49457
i thought i was getting sick this morning and laughed to myself if that were going to be the case


[02/14/2026 21:55] wintersloop_49457
but it was just transient nausea that i get from medication sometimes


[02/14/2026 21:55] thesewhitelights
From putting your body through a lot of stress this past week?


[02/14/2026 21:55] thesewhitelights
Oh good


[02/14/2026 21:55] thesewhitelights
Not good, but better than the alternative


[02/14/2026 21:55] wintersloop_49457
no all of that energy is put in a box until monday


[02/14/2026 21:56] wintersloop_49457
i have not even thought about it


[02/14/2026 21:56] thesewhitelights
Yes, but you also haven't been sleeping much, and you can't put that in a box


[02/14/2026 21:58] wintersloop_49457
yeah, so today i learned something else which i will also need to get a handle on


[02/14/2026 21:58] wintersloop_49457
i woke up after 6 hours unbothered by any work stress, happy


[02/14/2026 21:59] wintersloop_49457
but the reason i did not go back to bed is i couldn't stop thinking about you, haha


[02/14/2026 21:59] wintersloop_49457
so i came and told you my dreams


[02/14/2026 21:59] wintersloop_49457
that one i think i can train myself to recognize that i can take you back to bed with me, and go to sleep again


[02/14/2026 22:00] thesewhitelights
I am working on that, too

We are quite the pair


[02/14/2026 22:01] thesewhitelights
In our current state


[02/14/2026 22:02] wintersloop_49457
yes we really are


[02/14/2026 22:07] wintersloop_49457
how will you feel if i write about you and put it on my poetry site


[02/14/2026 22:07] wintersloop_49457
not with your name


[02/14/2026 22:10] thesewhitelights
Generally, I feel your experiences are yours, so it's not for me to say


[02/14/2026 22:10] wintersloop_49457
it's not for you to say, but i want to know how you will feel


[02/14/2026 22:10] wintersloop_49457
how you think you will feel


[02/14/2026 22:11] thesewhitelights
Can you share an example of the type of reaction/feeling you are wondering about?


[02/14/2026 22:12] wintersloop_49457
will you feel betrayed like i have shared something private, will you feel happy knowing i want to tell the universe about you, will you feel uncomfortable that my feelings about you are on display


[02/14/2026 22:12] wintersloop_49457
any of those are valid


[02/14/2026 22:13] wintersloop_49457
and many many more


[02/14/2026 22:13] wintersloop_49457
it's ok if you don't know what to say i'm just trying to be considerate of you


[02/14/2026 22:13] thesewhitelights
I will think about this more


[02/14/2026 22:13] thesewhitelights
I've never been considered or asked when this has happened in the past


[02/14/2026 22:14] wintersloop_49457
ok, thank you


[02/14/2026 22:17] thesewhitelights
I will still think on it, but for me it comes back to the feelings that were mentioned earlier about you doing what you want rather than what I want, which is not to say that I don't want you to post things, just I have learned to separate the two


[02/14/2026 22:17] thesewhitelights
"you" and "I" as other and self


[02/14/2026 22:18] wintersloop_49457
yeah 100%, the difference is that this directly involves you


[02/14/2026 22:18] wintersloop_49457
i would not ask you how you feel about me writing poems about bears


[02/14/2026 22:18] wintersloop_49457
well i would


[02/14/2026 22:18] wintersloop_49457
but it would weigh less heavily on my decision to post them


[02/14/2026 22:18] thesewhitelights
But you're the only one who knows that.  I won't make assumptions.


[02/14/2026 22:19] thesewhitelights
Even if you wrote, "Amy is a dumb cunt," you're writing about your feelings, not really about me

[02/14/2026 22:22] wintersloop_49457
i don't agree with this whole thing, like i do agree with it in the abstract, on generally long timelines, you should work to separate yourself from what others think about you, how they treat you, etc, that's not you, that is them, the way people act is about them usually


[02/14/2026 22:23] wintersloop_49457
but in our case, it's not entirely true, i consider myself to be a very emotionally resilient person, many people i've worked with in high stress environments probably think i don't have feelings at all


[02/14/2026 22:23] wintersloop_49457
but you could devastate me really easily with your words, because we have made ourselves vulnerable to one another


[02/14/2026 22:23] wintersloop_49457
you could just break me down in a few minutes if you tried


[02/14/2026 22:24] wintersloop_49457
it's not the same situation as the general case


[02/14/2026 22:24] wintersloop_49457
there's some amount of consideration you should pay one another when you mutually develop something like that


[02/14/2026 22:27] wintersloop_49457
it's not fair to say "well it's her problem if she's upset" when i know there's a predictable outcome of my actions


[02/14/2026 22:29] wintersloop_49457
i do agree it's my choice, and i'm telling you that the way i choose to do some things is to talk to you about them


[02/14/2026 22:29] thesewhitelights
And that means the world to me, more than you know (but you probably know because you know)


[02/14/2026 22:32] wintersloop_49457
yes we know


[02/14/2026 22:33] wintersloop_49457
i think you're overindexing on trying to use healthy generalized behaviors in a situation that isn't generic enough


[02/14/2026 22:33] thesewhitelights
I think so too


[02/14/2026 22:33] thesewhitelights
To some degree


[02/14/2026 22:34] wintersloop_49457
okey, i also don't mean to tell *you* what to do


[02/14/2026 22:35] wintersloop_49457
but we don't need to get into a meta analysis of who can be more kind, because we will just keep talking forever in that case haha


[02/14/2026 22:35] thesewhitelights
That actually came up during brunch, hahaha


[02/14/2026 22:35] wintersloop_49457

[02/14/2026 22:48] thesewhitelights
Are there two separate threads here?  One is about the act of you posting, the other is about the content and sentiment contained in what is posted?


[02/14/2026 22:48] wintersloop_49457
no


[02/14/2026 22:49] wintersloop_49457
the content and sentiment is useful to bring up because it lets us exaggerate the impact


[02/14/2026 22:49] wintersloop_49457
but the thing i'm talking about the entire time is posting it at all


[02/14/2026 22:49] wintersloop_49457
so btw, this is like an unhinged amount of writing for me to do, that i've done this week


[02/14/2026 22:50] wintersloop_49457
all of the poems on the website, 32 of them, were written over a period of like 20 years


[02/14/2026 22:50] wintersloop_49457
and i already did another one today that i think i just finished


[02/14/2026 22:51] thesewhitelights
I was wondering.  There have been multiple times when I've commented to myself that you are a machine and how do you sustain this pace


[02/14/2026 22:51] wintersloop_49457
well usually i'm channeling this into all of the programming i am supposed to be doing and i am actually a machine at that


[02/14/2026 22:51] wintersloop_49457
so it was lucky that this week i was not enthusiastic about the robots


[02/14/2026 22:52] wintersloop_49457
and very enthusiastic about you


[02/14/2026 22:52] thesewhitelights
us


[02/14/2026 22:52] wintersloop_49457
us


[02/14/2026 22:54] thesewhitelights
And all of the writing is a good thing?


[02/14/2026 22:55] wintersloop_49457
historically it just means i am emotional


[02/14/2026 22:55] wintersloop_49457
can't tell good or bad on its own


[02/14/2026 22:55] wintersloop_49457
i think it's great


[02/14/2026 22:55] wintersloop_49457
this week


[02/14/2026 22:56] thesewhitelights
Production is positive, even if it's just as an outlet then?


[02/14/2026 22:56] thesewhitelights
You have stuff that needs to get out


[02/14/2026 22:57] wintersloop_49457
i feel best when i make things, and even better when i make things for someone


[02/14/2026 22:58] wintersloop_49457
this one i finished today i was never going to even think of putting on my site, fyi, i just have a feeling there will be one at some point


[02/14/2026 22:59] thesewhitelights
I interpreted it as a future question


[02/14/2026 22:59] thesewhitelights
A question about the future


[02/14/2026 22:59] wintersloop_49457
yes yes


[02/14/2026 23:00] thesewhitelights
And you weren't just considerate in asking but considerate enough to give me time to think about it


[02/14/2026 23:00] thesewhitelights
That was my original interpretation


[02/14/2026 23:01] wintersloop_49457
yes that's what is happening


[02/14/2026 23:01] thesewhitelights
I'm happy you are happy


[02/14/2026 23:01] thesewhitelights
And that may be an understatement


[02/14/2026 23:02] wintersloop_49457
you will have a new poem on your table in a few minutes


[02/14/2026 23:02] wintersloop_49457
i am happy you are happy


[02/14/2026 23:24] thesewhitelights
The dancing I did in college was not ballet.  There was a variety of stuff thrown into my studies, somatic stuff, Feldenkrais, etc., but mostly a form referred to as contact improvisation.  It does not translate well to video, but I think you'd get it regardless if you went looking (I can share media later if you want).  Contact improv is improvisation based on contact with a partner or partners (never would have guessed that was the case with a name like that, I'm sure).  It requires a specific type of mutual understanding and trust because it's improvised so where it will go and how it will move is unpredictable.  This is a poor explanation that I'm sharing now because it is a rich communication without words.  I felt frustration the other day when I first uttered "comments that don't come in words" because I had so much to say but I'm not talented enough with the language of words to express it, and that's all we've got.  I shut off the communication without words when I left college the first time as a requirement for survival, but that will come back like my Minnesota accent when I'm in a place that feels like home.

[02/14/2026 23:25] wintersloop_49457
ok, we should go find that place together please


[02/14/2026 23:27] thesewhitelights
I think maybe this was a warning? hahaha


[02/14/2026 23:27] wintersloop_49457
have i told you that flow states are what i really really really want


[02/14/2026 23:27] wintersloop_49457
where you don't need to talk in order to know


[02/14/2026 23:28] wintersloop_49457
> What I want: someone who gets that flow state when you're cooking together and they already know you need the cutting board before you reach for it. Your hands become interchangeable. Doesn't have to be cooking. Could be a playlist, a painting, a terrible IKEA shelf, a life. I just want to make things with someone. That's home. I want to find someone and build something that lasts, one day at a time. Not sprinting toward anything. I'm a romantic at heart. Whatever cynicism I've accumulated strips away pretty easy once I start getting to know someone. I open up fast, so I've learned to start slow. I'm not fixated on marriage, not opposed to it either. What I actually like is the idea of growing alongside someone through years, then decades.


[02/14/2026 23:28] thesewhitelights
You put that in your post.


[02/14/2026 23:29] wintersloop_49457
yeah but not like that


[02/14/2026 23:29] wintersloop_49457
that's from the other post, the one you didn't respond to


[02/14/2026 23:30] thesewhitelights
I didn't respond, but I'd read it and it was inside me.  The second time I couldn't justify ignoring you.


[02/14/2026 23:31] wintersloop_49457
what do you mean a warning? it's ok if these things are difficult for you and you need to go find them again


[02/14/2026 23:31] wintersloop_49457
it's not an issue, if that's what you're saying


[02/14/2026 23:32] thesewhitelights
A warning that there is a good chance my body is going to be touching your body a lot if we are in the same place


[02/14/2026 23:32] wintersloop_49457
yeah that is the idea


[02/14/2026 23:33] thesewhitelights

yes, yes, of course


[02/14/2026 23:35] wintersloop_49457
what kind of apples? i have been doing the small granny smith apples for a while now


[02/14/2026 23:35] thesewhitelights
Grannies are good.  I love how they bite back.


[02/14/2026 23:36] wintersloop_49457
oh you added a word! i just realized though that i should let you delete them if you clicked wrong


[02/14/2026 23:37] thesewhitelights
If it's an apple, I will enjoy it unless it's the abomination that is Red Delicious.  I will still eat a Red Delicious if I have no other options.


[02/14/2026 23:37] thesewhitelights
I didn't add a word?


[02/14/2026 23:37] wintersloop_49457
oh nvm, it was my own i see locally while i'm working on it

the reult of me feeding garbage into it and seeing what happens


[02/14/2026 23:39] thesewhitelights
I will play with it!  I need at least 16 more deep breaths first, and it may take me a little while to remember how to breathe.


[02/14/2026 23:40] thesewhitelights
Because breath = taken away


[02/14/2026 23:40] wintersloop_49457

it's disorienting yeah


[02/15/2026 08:24] wintersloop_49457
we should make a gradual hangup system like one of those sunrise alarm clocks that slowly fades you out over ten minutes or whatever


[02/15/2026 08:26] wintersloop_49457
you did give a huge smile right as you were hanging up which helped


[02/15/2026 08:26] thesewhitelights
You mean a Minnesota goodbye?


[02/15/2026 08:27] wintersloop_49457
it's symbolically fitting that the moment you hung up i realized i was starving

It starts by slapping your knee and stating "Well, I should get going" and then it eventually moves to the hallway.  20 minutes later you've made it to the door.  20 Minutes after that you make it to the car.  You get in the car, the door may be open or the window may be down, and the conversation keeps going...


[02/15/2026 08:28] thesewhitelights
I knew you were hungry


[02/15/2026 08:28] thesewhitelights
How did you not know you were hungry?


[02/15/2026 08:28] wintersloop_49457
i don't know, i didn't feel the pangs


[02/15/2026 08:28] thesewhitelights
Your attention was elsewhere


[02/15/2026 08:28] wintersloop_49457
100% locked in


[02/15/2026 08:29] wintersloop_49457

[02/15/2026 08:29] wintersloop_49457

That is not the word, but I know you know that


[02/15/2026 08:30] thesewhitelights
And seeing you happy, relaxed, comfortable, full, just amplifies that feeling soooooo much


[02/15/2026 08:30] wintersloop_49457
agreed


[02/15/2026 08:30] wintersloop_49457
it's the best


[02/15/2026 08:30] thesewhitelights
Thank you for being my valentine


[02/15/2026 08:31] thesewhitelights
And making it possible for us to be together


[02/15/2026 08:31] wintersloop_49457
of course, you too


[02/15/2026 08:31] wintersloop_49457
now that i've soaked you up it is a lot easier to imagine you


[02/15/2026 08:32] thesewhitelights
you mean the presence?


[02/15/2026 08:32] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/15/2026 08:32] wintersloop_49457
it's easier to hear you


[02/15/2026 08:33] thesewhitelights
I'm telling you what doesn't come in words


[02/15/2026 08:34] wintersloop_49457
it's so good


[02/15/2026 08:34] wintersloop_49457

[02/15/2026 08:40] wintersloop_49457
do you think we could find the discipline to do that in person


[02/15/2026 08:40] wintersloop_49457
sit for 6 hours and learn one another face to face


[02/15/2026 08:41] wintersloop_49457
i'm positive we could do it with our clothes off, but that's not what i mean


[02/15/2026 08:41] thesewhitelights
If we'd just met like we did tonight?


[02/15/2026 08:42] wintersloop_49457
at any time, i mean the desire just keeps growing, for me at least, i don't know i'd have made it nearly that long without kissing you


[02/15/2026 08:43] wintersloop_49457
oh, no, i mean in real life, sometime


[02/15/2026 08:43] wintersloop_49457
we could try


[02/15/2026 08:43] wintersloop_49457
not hypothetically


[02/15/2026 08:43] wintersloop_49457
i think it would be intense


[02/15/2026 08:44] thesewhitelights
I'm trying to convince myself I could, but that may be a bigger lie than goodnight


[02/15/2026 08:44] wintersloop_49457
maybe it is like a muscle that we can practice at


[02/15/2026 08:44] thesewhitelights
You would have to be very far away, on the other side of the room


[02/15/2026 08:44] wintersloop_49457
i also have vague notions that this might be what tantra is?


[02/15/2026 08:47] wintersloop_49457
i have never done anything like that before because the tension has always been broken, what i'm saying is that there is a different kind of fulfillment i was getting out of doing that


[02/15/2026 08:48] wintersloop_49457
i think it could be a cool thing to try and practice in person, i also think it would make physical contact even more enjoyable afterwards


[02/15/2026 08:49] thesewhitelights
I agree on all accounts


[02/15/2026 08:49] thesewhitelights
Thinking about us being in physical contact makes me feel a little faint


[02/15/2026 08:50] wintersloop_49457
i like thinking of you like that


[02/15/2026 08:50] wintersloop_49457
a little overwhelmed with feeling, wanting


[02/15/2026 08:51] wintersloop_49457
i'm the same although it's not faint as much as like, where am i supposed to put all of this energy


[02/15/2026 08:51] wintersloop_49457
oh my god i didn't change the laundry


[02/15/2026 08:52] thesewhitelights
nooooo!


[02/15/2026 08:52] thesewhitelights
I'm sorry for distracting you


[02/15/2026 08:53] thesewhitelights
I'm not sorry and I don't take your attention for granted, but I do wish you had clean sheets


[02/15/2026 08:53] thesewhitelights
clean sheets are the best


[02/15/2026 08:54] wintersloop_49457
ok i have resolved the issue


[02/15/2026 08:54] wintersloop_49457
i just lined the couch with a comforter and that's going to be my bed


[02/15/2026 08:55] thesewhitelights
the couch that fits two people


[02/15/2026 08:55] wintersloop_49457
yeah i have you right here


[02/15/2026 08:55] wintersloop_49457
in our bedclothes


[02/15/2026 08:55] thesewhitelights
mmmmmmmmm


[02/15/2026 08:57] thesewhitelights
are you ready for sleep?


[02/15/2026 08:57] thesewhitelights
it is so late


[02/15/2026 08:57] wintersloop_49457
what was the thing you were thinking you didn't want to say, early in the call


[02/15/2026 08:58] thesewhitelights
I was on the verge of being quite overwhelmed with want, and then you touched your arm


[02/15/2026 08:59] thesewhitelights
the arm that I will touch and the arm that will hold me


[02/15/2026 08:59] wintersloop_49457
yes please


[02/15/2026 09:00] wintersloop_49457
i want to know how you want to be touched


[02/15/2026 09:00] wintersloop_49457
i will ask you tomorrow, so you can think


[02/15/2026 09:01] wintersloop_49457
it's ok if it feels like too much and you don't want to say, but i am going ask you


[02/15/2026 09:01] thesewhitelights
It's not a matter of don't want to


[02/15/2026 09:02] thesewhitelights
It's a matter of am I able to


[02/15/2026 09:02] wintersloop_49457
ok i understand


[02/15/2026 09:03] wintersloop_49457
i like communication about how to touch, eye contact


[02/15/2026 09:03] wintersloop_49457
those are what make it good for me


[02/15/2026 09:03] thesewhitelights
be strategic in your questioning because you can so easily render me speechless

i could maybe just ask everything as a yes or no for you


[02/15/2026 09:06] wintersloop_49457
hearing you ask for something, then giving you what you ask for is 👌🏻


[02/15/2026 09:06] wintersloop_49457
so we should learn to talk


[02/15/2026 09:06] wintersloop_49457
there's no rush


[02/15/2026 09:07] thesewhitelights
oh, I'll be fine, we will be fine, more than fine


[02/15/2026 09:07] thesewhitelights
But talking about it tomorrow?  I'll unravel


[02/15/2026 09:07] wintersloop_49457
ok that is fair


[02/15/2026 09:08] thesewhitelights
That's why I didn't tell you what I was thinking when I was thinking it.  That was only an hour into the conversation?  We had so much more to get through (in the best of ways)


[02/15/2026 09:09] wintersloop_49457
yeah i agree


[02/15/2026 09:09] thesewhitelights
I'm so glad we're in this together


[02/15/2026 09:10] wintersloop_49457
it's really good, i'm happy we have time to explore and figure it out


[02/15/2026 09:10] wintersloop_49457
i am going to hold you close and go to sleep


[02/15/2026 09:11] thesewhitelights
I hope you sleep well while you can, and I hope you have good dreams


[02/15/2026 09:11] wintersloop_49457

[02/15/2026 13:55] wintersloop_49457
so "deserve" comes from old french deservir, from latin deservire, which literally meant "to serve well" or "to serve zealously."  de- was an intensifier, plus servire, to serve. so to deserve something originally meant you earned it through service. you served, therefore you are owed


[02/15/2026 13:56] wintersloop_49457
but the modern french descendant is desservir, and over time the word basically inverted its own meaning. som dictionaries defines desservir as: to serve, to clear, to make things difficult for. all three meanings, in the same word?

[02/15/2026 13:59] wintersloop_49457
you could look at it like the des- prefix shifted from intensifier to negator, but i don't think that's actually what happened. it's still an intensifier. it's just that when you intensify service, when you serve so completely that you've fully served, what's left?


[02/15/2026 13:59] wintersloop_49457
oh and dessert comes from the same verb. desservir, to clear the table. dessert is literally the course that arrives after the un-serving


[02/15/2026 14:59] wintersloop_49457
thanks for last night again


[02/15/2026 15:00] wintersloop_49457
i'll be back in a few hours, i am assuming you are still asleep which is making me happy you are getting some good rest


[02/15/2026 17:10] thesewhitelights
I had just woken up when you were typing that last message and was still blurry-eyed when I read the last line about you being happy because I was getting good sleep.  My whole being filled with warmth and I smiled and closed my eyes and immediately went back to sleep.  I slept really well, and the credit goes to you.  Thank you for that, and for last night, and for being you.  I hope you were able to get enough sleep to get through your day.  I've been thinking about you and imagining you moving through it.

Was the etymology this morning because it was a half-finished investigation floating around in your head


[02/15/2026 19:00] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/15/2026 19:00] wintersloop_49457
i mean it was a strange thing to float to the top of the list when i woke up though


[02/15/2026 19:01] thesewhitelights
It was a surprise, and I was excited to read it


[02/15/2026 19:03] wintersloop_49457

[02/15/2026 19:06] thesewhitelights
I just received a request from my dad for a Zoom call, so I'm about to do that.  But I'll be back after my chat with Mr. Peter.  Maybe an hour? Hour and a half?  Sometimes he is chatty.


[02/15/2026 19:07] wintersloop_49457
ok cool, enjoy


[02/15/2026 19:07] wintersloop_49457

[02/15/2026 20:45] wintersloop_49457
it's that kinda of feeling, not really nervous just, restless


[02/15/2026 20:45] thesewhitelights

[02/16/2026 04:07] wintersloop_49457
yeah it knows about the site content, who i am, and who you are


[02/16/2026 04:07] wintersloop_49457
i'm impressed at bananamoon though


[02/16/2026 04:07] wintersloop_49457
what a considerate bot


[02/16/2026 04:09] thesewhitelights
Looking out for your interests clearly


[02/16/2026 04:10] wintersloop_49457
i didn't instruct it to do that but i did tell it i like you


[02/16/2026 04:10] thesewhitelights
bot's got your back


[02/16/2026 04:11] wintersloop_49457
ohhhh, no i did include this


[02/16/2026 04:11] wintersloop_49457
The core dynamic (between Amy & Mike):
🌙🍌 — their moon/banana inside joke
👻 — her friendly haunting promise
🐸 — Kermit the hermit haven
👺 — "that's my face!" (her monster)
🎶 — music as their connection thread

so that it would understand these specifically


[02/16/2026 04:12] wintersloop_49457
i was very tired when i did this


[02/16/2026 04:13] thesewhitelights
I can't believe you made this for me


[02/16/2026 04:13] wintersloop_49457
this was like 6am i have to make amy the best valentine


[02/16/2026 04:13] thesewhitelights
You succeeded


[02/16/2026 04:13] thesewhitelights
It's so good I can't really talk about it yet


[02/16/2026 04:13] wintersloop_49457
it's ok you don't have to, you have fed me so much


[02/16/2026 04:14] thesewhitelights

You know where I've been sitting on our calls?  There's a small bookshelf next to me (where I set my tea).  It holds a few books from when I was studying and a few books from when I was teaching and a treasure box where I keep my Star Trek playing cards.  There are other items (pencil case, notebook, postcards) include a copy of Letters to a Young Poet

I should have given you a tour of my little corner


[02/16/2026 04:23] wintersloop_49457
there are so many more days to share the things


[02/16/2026 04:25] wintersloop_49457
ok, this is my selection, i have so many more things but i whittled it down and tried to describe why they matter


[02/16/2026 04:25] wintersloop_49457
but, if *you* have books we should read, i don't actually care what we read, thing i actually want is just to read with you


[02/16/2026 04:25] thesewhitelights
This list and your efforts mean so much to me


[02/16/2026 04:27] thesewhitelights
We will read Bog Myrtle

[02/16/2026 04:30] wintersloop_49457

[02/16/2026 04:34] wintersloop_49457
there are a lot of things in there that are us, including being suspicious of premature labels, how it is necessary for people to have rich inner worlds and then choose to share them (as opposed to feeling obligated, or desperate) in order for real connections to happen, seeking quick answers in your head is not right and you need to live through the answer until you know it in your bones


[02/16/2026 04:34] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/16/2026 04:34] wintersloop_49457

i'm yelling at my computer rn


[02/16/2026 04:35] thesewhitelights
Good yelling or bad yelling?


[02/16/2026 04:35] wintersloop_49457
the improbably identical ways of seeing the world yelling


[02/16/2026 04:36] wintersloop_49457
the mechanics of joy and the surprise of being known


[02/16/2026 04:38] wintersloop_49457
what are the chances that i've been thinking of these exact words from rilke you have marked, really?


[02/16/2026 04:39] thesewhitelights
Impossible


[02/16/2026 04:39] thesewhitelights
But possible


[02/16/2026 04:39] thesewhitelights
Somehow


[02/16/2026 04:40] wintersloop_49457
have you seen jojo rabbit


[02/16/2026 04:40] thesewhitelights
I have not


[02/16/2026 04:40] wintersloop_49457
ok do you want to watch some movies this week?


[02/16/2026 04:41] thesewhitelights
With you?


[02/16/2026 04:41] thesewhitelights
Yes


[02/16/2026 04:41] wintersloop_49457
yes please


[02/16/2026 04:45] thesewhitelights
Maybe when we do I will show up in my underwear and then pretend I have something on my thigh to show you innocently

This is my life now


[02/16/2026 04:48] wintersloop_49457
our


[02/16/2026 04:48] thesewhitelights
thank you


[02/16/2026 04:49] wintersloop_49457
i'm kinda losing my mind with want when watching you in a hoodie


[02/16/2026 04:51] wintersloop_49457
but, i will never say no to more of you


[02/16/2026 04:52] thesewhitelights
We will starve.


[02/16/2026 04:53] wintersloop_49457
we will


[02/16/2026 04:54] thesewhitelights
For the briefest second this afternoon, I allowed myself to imagine what it will be like to stand in front of you for the first time.


[02/16/2026 04:55] wintersloop_49457
you are literally going to be swept off your feet


[02/16/2026 04:55] thesewhitelights
That's probably a good thing because I may actually go weak in the knees


[02/16/2026 04:57] wintersloop_49457
i'm actually surprised that i don't fantasize about you while i am looking at you, increasingly i do now while i'm sitting alone though


[02/16/2026 04:59] thesewhitelights
You are very present


[02/16/2026 04:59] thesewhitelights
and that makes me sooooooooo happy


[02/16/2026 04:59] thesewhitelights
how comfortable you are


[02/16/2026 05:00] wintersloop_49457
it is a really good feeling, it's also another one of those things that i have understood, and practiced, and wanted to be very good at


[02/16/2026 05:00] wintersloop_49457
and it's like you either had perfect timing or you activated it, or both


[02/16/2026 05:01] wintersloop_49457
but it is really surprising to me that i do remain present like that with you, don't even have to try


[02/16/2026 05:01] wintersloop_49457
for someone with ADHD like i have, it is a miracle


[02/16/2026 05:02] thesewhitelights
I have a deep understanding of that last part, and I feel so lucky to be a part of that experience with you


[02/16/2026 05:06] wintersloop_49457
ok so, actually i'm just remembering, when you took your glasses off, my heart rate went up, i got a little aroused, i didn't want to say that to you. my point is though, like you're saying, it may be truer than i would like to believe that i would pass out if you showed up in your underwear, so just be wary


[02/16/2026 05:06] thesewhitelights
I wouldn't


[02/16/2026 05:06] wintersloop_49457
i am really tuned to you


[02/16/2026 05:06] thesewhitelights
At least not soon


[02/16/2026 05:07] thesewhitelights
I


[02/16/2026 05:07] wintersloop_49457
i wouldn't complain, but the most important thing is that we are both comfy and enjoying


[02/16/2026 05:07] thesewhitelights
I'm mindful that the conversation may stop


[02/16/2026 05:07] thesewhitelights
For one or both of us


[02/16/2026 05:08] wintersloop_49457
you mean like, we don't want to continue, generally? or you mean, that introducing something like that would make conversation difficult in the moment


[02/16/2026 05:08] thesewhitelights
Make conversation more difficult in the moment


[02/16/2026 05:08] wintersloop_49457
oh, yeah, for sure


[02/16/2026 05:09] thesewhitelights
Oh, that was scary "the conversation may stop" and I'm sorry I was careless with my phrasing.


[02/16/2026 05:10] wintersloop_49457
ty for reassurance


[02/16/2026 05:10] wintersloop_49457
the convo would be really hard for me, maybe, in most cases, but i think there is a lot going on that would not be happening if we got too in our heads about sex


[02/16/2026 05:11] wintersloop_49457
but, there is also part of me that wonders if we can develop the same kind of presence and comfort with our bodies anyways, without it needing to be about that exactly


[02/16/2026 05:11] wintersloop_49457
either way, this is an advanced topic in getting to know one another


[02/16/2026 05:12] wintersloop_49457
and we have plenty of other ground to cover


[02/16/2026 05:12] thesewhitelights
I 100% believe we can be present and comfortable and honest with our bodies without it being about sexsexsexsex


[02/16/2026 05:13] wintersloop_49457
yes me too, but it will take discipline, for me i know


[02/16/2026 05:13] wintersloop_49457
i have been pretty good about not letting my mind linger on that too much, don't want to overproduce it in my head


[02/16/2026 05:14] wintersloop_49457
but the thought initiates all the time


[02/16/2026 05:15] thesewhitelights
I suspect, and evidence suggests, that like most things between us with transpire and progress naturally as they should


[02/16/2026 05:17] wintersloop_49457
for sure, amy is much better than fantasy amy


[02/16/2026 05:17] wintersloop_49457
that's actually a perfectly coherent explanation as to why i don't fantasize about you while i'm looking at you


[02/16/2026 05:17] wintersloop_49457
now that i think about it


[02/16/2026 05:18] thesewhitelights
that makes perfect sense to me


[02/16/2026 05:22] thesewhitelights
Are you sitting at your desk?


[02/16/2026 05:23] wintersloop_49457
no, why


[02/16/2026 05:23] wintersloop_49457
i can be


[02/16/2026 05:23] thesewhitelights
Not a request for you to go there, I was just wondering


[02/16/2026 05:23] thesewhitelights
You've now showed me around, so I can picture you in places


[02/16/2026 05:24] thesewhitelights
Oh! I did think of a request! Will you put the book list on the table?


[02/16/2026 05:24] thesewhitelights
Not immediately but eventually


[02/16/2026 05:24] wintersloop_49457
oh, for sure, i will do it right now


[02/16/2026 05:24] wintersloop_49457
it won't take long


[02/16/2026 05:25] thesewhitelights
thank you

yeah, haha, it's so good


[02/16/2026 05:25] thesewhitelights
I'm so honored!


[02/16/2026 05:25] thesewhitelights
Before you sent the pic, I was typing to ask you if the cover had pictures of space


[02/16/2026 05:26] wintersloop_49457
no i have found something better


[02/16/2026 05:27] wintersloop_49457
it's apples and stars, so both, really


[02/16/2026 05:27] thesewhitelights
hahaha, you're right


[02/16/2026 05:27] thesewhitelights
perfect


[02/16/2026 05:27] thesewhitelights
still honored by the apples


[02/16/2026 05:27] wintersloop_49457
when you look at the site are you usually on mobile or your laptop


[02/16/2026 05:28] thesewhitelights
The valentine? Only on my laptop


[02/16/2026 05:28] thesewhitelights
I don't use the internet on my phone unless I absolutely have to


[02/16/2026 05:28] wintersloop_49457
have you seen the anxious banana when you leave


[02/16/2026 05:28] thesewhitelights
At the top?


[02/16/2026 05:29] wintersloop_49457
yeah, if you open another tab and are not looking at the site, the tab for the site will show the banana pacing


[02/16/2026 05:29] thesewhitelights
I have seen it, and when I first saw it, I said, "Me too, banana"


[02/16/2026 05:29] wintersloop_49457
ok good this was an important detail


[02/16/2026 05:29] thesewhitelights
It was not missed


[02/16/2026 05:35] wintersloop_49457
i'm happy you asked for something, it's good for it to be the things you want


[02/16/2026 05:39] thesewhitelights
I wanted to ask you for something that would be useful to me, and that came to mind


[02/16/2026 05:49] wintersloop_49457
ok it is up there

[02/16/2026 05:52] wintersloop_49457
it is


[02/16/2026 05:52] wintersloop_49457
i think you have made me more comfortable in my own skin


[02/16/2026 05:54] thesewhitelights
and that thought makes me incredibly happy


[02/16/2026 05:55] thesewhitelights
I want to give to you, too


[02/16/2026 05:55] wintersloop_49457
i know you do, i can feel it


[02/16/2026 05:55] wintersloop_49457
i appreciate you


[02/16/2026 05:56] thesewhitelights
How can I help tomorrow?


[02/16/2026 05:56] wintersloop_49457
like with me being predictably stressed?


[02/16/2026 05:56] thesewhitelights
yes


[02/16/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
just being amy is a lot, a lot of help, and if i feel like i need something from you i am going to ask for it


[02/16/2026 05:57] wintersloop_49457
oh! you are off work though?


[02/16/2026 05:58] wintersloop_49457
we could listen to music together, that would make my day great


[02/16/2026 05:58] thesewhitelights
I am!  And I will likely be dipping truffles in the afternoon which means listening to music would be perfect


[02/16/2026 05:58] thesewhitelights
I will also tell you how my appointment goes


[02/16/2026 05:58] wintersloop_49457
it is good because you don't have to really sit at the computer or anything, just queue up some music you want me to hear


[02/16/2026 05:59] wintersloop_49457
oh, yes, yes please


[02/16/2026 06:00] thesewhitelights
and I will daydream about scratching your back even though me daydreaming won't actually help in reality


[02/16/2026 06:01] wintersloop_49457
it does help i think because it's going to make the thing better when it happens, i think


[02/16/2026 06:03] wintersloop_49457
i have a few things that i keep imagining along these lines which are like holding you until you fall asleep, pressing my knuckles into your lower back and shoulders to see if i can loosen them up, rubbing your feet, scratching your head, tracing your face


[02/16/2026 06:05] wintersloop_49457
it's like a little meditation on bringing you relief


[02/16/2026 06:05] thesewhitelights
we are so good for each other and to each other


[02/16/2026 06:05] wintersloop_49457
yes, we are


[02/16/2026 06:06] thesewhitelights
You already take VERY good care of me, more than you know


[02/16/2026 06:07] thesewhitelights
Well, you might know because you seem to knwo things, but it's more than I can say


[02/16/2026 06:07] wintersloop_49457
i know what effort does, i am happy you feel it


[02/16/2026 06:08] wintersloop_49457
effort, time, attention, we are good at showing each other we care, it's easy to feel it


[02/16/2026 06:09] thesewhitelights
I just thought of a song I want you to listen to!  I'll save it for tomorrow


[02/16/2026 06:11] wintersloop_49457
so many


[02/16/2026 06:11] wintersloop_49457
can i share one with you now


[02/16/2026 06:11] thesewhitelights
yes please


[02/16/2026 06:12] thesewhitelights
I can share the one I thought of just now if you'd like


[02/16/2026 06:13] wintersloop_49457
we can listen now and tomorrow!

Only a few things

have not thought of this song in a long time until this past week


[02/16/2026 06:15] thesewhitelights
This is a very beautiful song


[02/16/2026 06:15] thesewhitelights
the one you sent


[02/16/2026 06:15] wintersloop_49457
yeah it just plainly says what matters


[02/16/2026 06:15] wintersloop_49457
i love it


[02/16/2026 06:16] wintersloop_49457
i need to put more yo la tengo on my lists, i have a few songs, this is nice


[02/16/2026 06:17] thesewhitelights
on the list you sent?  I haven't gotten through all of it


[02/16/2026 06:17] wintersloop_49457
oh, no it's not on that list, i would have gotten to them eventually


[02/16/2026 06:18] wintersloop_49457
when i start naming artists i go through them as they are associated in my memory of having listened to them around the same time


[02/16/2026 06:18] wintersloop_49457
i did this once on paper and got through about 300 artists before i stopped, if i had done that on the list i made you there'd have been 900+ songs


[02/16/2026 06:19] thesewhitelights
My contributions will be paltry in comparison


[02/16/2026 06:19] wintersloop_49457
you could very easily argue quality over quantity


[02/16/2026 06:20] wintersloop_49457
and every little bit of everything you love is really important to me, so i wouldn't look at it like that


[02/16/2026 06:20] wintersloop_49457
i want to know what you like


[02/16/2026 06:22] thesewhitelights
You are real?  Really real?


[02/16/2026 06:22] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/16/2026 06:22] thesewhitelights
Good


[02/16/2026 06:23] thesewhitelights
I'm really happy you have clean sheets tonight


[02/16/2026 06:24] wintersloop_49457
me too, they are super comfy


[02/16/2026 06:24] thesewhitelights
my shoulders just relaxed a little reading that


[02/16/2026 06:25] wintersloop_49457
telekinetic massage


[02/16/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
apparently


[02/16/2026 06:25] thesewhitelights
and priorities


[02/16/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/16/2026 06:26] wintersloop_49457
i think you've been brave enough to know what priorities are a lot longer than me


[02/16/2026 06:28] thesewhitelights
Maybe so, but you seem to be thoughtful about them now


[02/16/2026 06:28] wintersloop_49457
i'm still stumbling, i think


[02/16/2026 06:29] wintersloop_49457
not on you though


[02/16/2026 06:30] thesewhitelights
I feel it


[02/16/2026 06:30] thesewhitelights
which is an incredibly foreign feeling


[02/16/2026 06:31] wintersloop_49457
here too, i have just accepted it


[02/16/2026 06:31] wintersloop_49457
you have to give trust to get it


[02/16/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
and a lot of the time that doesn't work out


[02/16/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
so thank you, really


[02/16/2026 06:32] thesewhitelights
What have you accepted?  I may have lost track here


[02/16/2026 06:32] wintersloop_49457
that you're with me, you are here for me


[02/16/2026 06:33] thesewhitelights
Good, good, those things are true


[02/16/2026 06:33] wintersloop_49457
it's a hard thing to accept that it would happen that easily, is what i mean


[02/16/2026 06:33] wintersloop_49457
i think that's what you're saying is the foreign feeling?


[02/16/2026 06:33] thesewhitelights
I have never been a priority like that to anyone I think


[02/16/2026 06:33] thesewhitelights
Not even my parents


[02/16/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
i'm sorry it's been like that, but i will tell you every day


[02/16/2026 06:34] thesewhitelights
That's what I meant by foreign


[02/16/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
you're worth it, for sure


[02/16/2026 06:34] thesewhitelights
I don't feel bad about the life I've lived


[02/16/2026 06:34] thesewhitelights
I appreciate your attention


[02/16/2026 06:35] wintersloop_49457
you shouldn't feel bad


[02/16/2026 06:35] wintersloop_49457
things that aren't fair happen to great people constantly, you could argue by necessity


[02/16/2026 06:35] wintersloop_49457
and i'm expressing that it doesn't feel fair that you wouldn't be prioritized


[02/16/2026 06:36] thesewhitelights
Thanks for explaining


[02/16/2026 06:36] wintersloop_49457
you have been prioritizing people your whole life


[02/16/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
Because I know what it's like not to be, so if I can do it for others, I will


[02/16/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
i know


[02/16/2026 06:37] wintersloop_49457
that's you, that is the best


[02/16/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
I'm sleepy, and I comfy all tucked up next to you


[02/16/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
ok good, yes we should sleep


[02/16/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
i think our celebratory week might be coming to a close and we should aim for sustainable affection this week


[02/16/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
Agreed


[02/16/2026 06:39] thesewhitelights
Naturally


[02/16/2026 06:40] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to try and fill my jar up and also give you a lot of time, that's the goal


[02/16/2026 06:40] wintersloop_49457
if i do all the jar things you can have the rest of my day


[02/16/2026 06:41] thesewhitelights
I will be here even if your attention is elsewhere, and I won't feel bad about that


[02/16/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
thank you


[02/16/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
that one means a lot, i don't think anyone has ever said that to me


[02/16/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
i will do the same for you when i can


[02/16/2026 06:42] thesewhitelights
Of course


[02/16/2026 06:42] thesewhitelights
If you have things you need/want to do, I fully -- fully -- support you doing them and am happy when you are doing them


[02/16/2026 06:43] wintersloop_49457
also even if i'm busy, if you're having a hard time with anything, i will drop everything


[02/16/2026 06:43] wintersloop_49457
but yeah i have a lot of things i need to try and pull together to keep my life on track here


[02/16/2026 06:43] thesewhitelights
I know you would


[02/16/2026 06:44] thesewhitelights
Your life and happiness and sanity are very important to me


[02/16/2026 06:44] wintersloop_49457
and yours mine


[02/16/2026 06:44] thesewhitelights
I really loved your spinach sandwich


[02/16/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
yes! it's really good


[02/16/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
i'll make them for you


[02/16/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
but i can use tomatoes instead of chicken if you like


[02/16/2026 06:45] thesewhitelights
I ask myself can I adore this man any more than I already do?  And then you make a spinach sandwich

I always try my best

what time is your appt?


[02/16/2026 15:19] thesewhitelights
8:00am


[02/16/2026 15:19] wintersloop_49457
oh ok glhf


[02/16/2026 15:19] thesewhitelights
good luck, have fun?


[02/16/2026 15:20] thesewhitelights
It took me at least 10 minutes to figure out ntb


[02/16/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457
lol


[02/16/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457
ok yes, you got the acronym


[02/16/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457
but i am guessing not the exact meaning because


[02/16/2026 15:20] wintersloop_49457
it started as a thing gamers would say to one another before an online match


[02/16/2026 15:21] wintersloop_49457
like... 20 years ago?


[02/16/2026 15:21] wintersloop_49457
and now it has become part of speech that means basically "you're gonna kill it"


[02/16/2026 15:22] wintersloop_49457
meant to encourage and hope for enjoyment, success in whatever you're going to do


[02/16/2026 15:22] thesewhitelights
I appreciate you soooo much


[02/16/2026 15:22] thesewhitelights
I love it when you teach me things


[02/16/2026 15:23] wintersloop_49457
it feels good to share things with you


[02/16/2026 15:23] wintersloop_49457
ty


[02/16/2026 15:25] wintersloop_49457
i'm sure you've noticed, but i am a fan of accepting language as it changes generationally, even though it's getting measurably shittier


[02/16/2026 15:26] wintersloop_49457
i can put on whatever style when i write, but normal speech feels right to me at whatever register most humans are currently using


[02/16/2026 17:03] thesewhitelights
Good drugs by March 1st!

[02/16/2026 17:04] wintersloop_49457
we should throw a little party


[02/16/2026 17:07] wintersloop_49457

Things you would like to know:

+ I don't have a headache right now
+ When I checked in with myself while waiting for my doctor to come into the exam room, I realized my shoulders were in my ears.  I thought of you and instantly relaxed
+ I'm currently listening to Whip it On (album) from The Raveonettes and dancing around my apartment while plotting out my next move with the truffles & because I am excited about making black bean burgers today (because I've been craving them since our conversation yesterday).  Sometimes even making a good dinner calls for a dance party

do you want to give this playlist thing a try


[02/16/2026 18:19] wintersloop_49457
i have like 10 min before my next meeting, i will keep my earbuds in and listen during meetings 🤫


[02/16/2026 18:20] thesewhitelights
We can, or we can wait until another time


[02/16/2026 18:21] thesewhitelights
I don't think my music is work music for you


[02/16/2026 18:21] wintersloop_49457
it's ok, it probably isn't, i want it though!


[02/16/2026 18:21] wintersloop_49457
we can interleave them


[02/16/2026 18:22] wintersloop_49457
it's a passive way for me to feel connected to you which is good no matter what


[02/16/2026 18:22] wintersloop_49457
Add new songs to the queue by searching for them or ask your guests to go to festify.us and enter this code:

[02/16/2026 18:23] thesewhitelights
We're doing it!


[02/16/2026 18:26] wintersloop_49457
is it letting you add things


[02/16/2026 18:26] thesewhitelights
I haven't tried yet


[02/16/2026 18:27] wintersloop_49457
i tried refreshing which was apparently a nono


[02/16/2026 18:27] wintersloop_49457
it reset the song to the middle of it


[02/16/2026 18:27] thesewhitelights
What are the terms?  Songs that make my ears tingle?  Songs I think you might enjoy?  Songs with sentimental for reasons that may not be obvious?


[02/16/2026 18:27] thesewhitelights
Am I supposed to be hearing the music?


[02/16/2026 18:27] wintersloop_49457
anything you want to share with me is great


[02/16/2026 18:27] wintersloop_49457
yeah you are, do you not?


[02/16/2026 18:28] thesewhitelights
I do not, but I see the progress bar progressing


[02/16/2026 18:28] wintersloop_49457
oh that's dumb, there are like a bunch of these services and i tried 2 or 3 of them out, this one seemed the most reliable


[02/16/2026 18:29] thesewhitelights
We can try later


[02/16/2026 18:30] wintersloop_49457
yeah i will look at stuff, thanks for coming and trying


[02/16/2026 18:38] thesewhitelights
I may have solved the problem.  I signed up for Spotify.


[02/16/2026 18:54] wintersloop_49457
oh!


[02/16/2026 18:57] wintersloop_49457

[02/16/2026 18:59] thesewhitelights

[02/16/2026 18:59] wintersloop_49457
do you like teddy bears


[02/16/2026 19:00] wintersloop_49457
also tbh i think i am better at sales than dan and juan and i feel like a complete moron for working with them for this long


[02/16/2026 19:00] thesewhitelights
I have a 2-bedroom apartment, and one room is filled entirely with teddy bears


[02/16/2026 19:01] wintersloop_49457
YES, they are going to need to make room


[02/16/2026 19:01] wintersloop_49457
can you hear the music


[02/16/2026 19:01] thesewhitelights
I do not own a teddy bear


[02/16/2026 19:02] wintersloop_49457
i am confused, are the teddy bears independent bears from you with their own plans and hopes for the future


[02/16/2026 19:03] thesewhitelights
No, I was being sarcastic


[02/16/2026 19:03] thesewhitelights
My 2nd bedroom is filled with cardboard boxes and yarn


[02/16/2026 19:03] thesewhitelights
That one is the truth


[02/16/2026 19:03] wintersloop_49457
lol well the yarn is going to need to make room


[02/16/2026 19:04] thesewhitelights
I better start knitting


[02/16/2026 19:05] thesewhitelights
Do I have to attach Spotify to Discord in order to access the playlist we're going to be building?


[02/16/2026 19:05] wintersloop_49457
no, the playlist is built on the web interface, oh wait we can just use spotify and not use that thing at all i think


[02/16/2026 19:05] wintersloop_49457
https://spotify.link/5W5p6hVqO0b


[02/16/2026 19:06] wintersloop_49457
you should just need to click that and then potentially log into spotify on the web


[02/16/2026 19:07] wintersloop_49457
it should maybe open the desktop app for you if you installed it, but probably just work on the website if youo haven't


[02/16/2026 19:17] thesewhitelights
Okay, I'm not listening to your playlist (with Ted but no teddy bears)


[02/16/2026 19:17] wintersloop_49457
ohhhh nice, ok cool you should be able to add songs


[02/16/2026 19:18] wintersloop_49457
if you search spotify and right click on a song anywhere it should say like add to queue or add to jam


[02/16/2026 19:18] wintersloop_49457
if you press play on the song though, it will stop playing my playlist and play that song


[02/16/2026 19:19] thesewhitelights
It might take me a bit to get used to this


[02/16/2026 19:20] wintersloop_49457
we got all the time ever


[02/16/2026 19:22] thesewhitelights
I'm not seeing where I can add to your jam.  Maybe you can show me later?  For now it's nice knowing your ears and my ears are hearing the same sounds while I listen along to your list?

[02/16/2026 19:23] wintersloop_49457
i just go browse spotify, like type a song name into the searchbar, pull up a playlist


[02/16/2026 19:23] wintersloop_49457
right click on a song, you should see that menu


[02/16/2026 19:24] wintersloop_49457
and then select add to queue, it should add it to the jam


[02/16/2026 19:24] thesewhitelights
Success!


[02/16/2026 19:24] wintersloop_49457
YES


[02/16/2026 19:24] thesewhitelights
I do not love fucking with your playlist and vibe


[02/16/2026 19:25] wintersloop_49457
yes you do


[02/16/2026 19:25] thesewhitelights
I do not!


[02/16/2026 19:25] wintersloop_49457
it's like a little message


[02/16/2026 19:25] thesewhitelights
But I will talk myself into it


[02/16/2026 19:25] wintersloop_49457
that says i'm here listening with you


[02/16/2026 19:25] wintersloop_49457
it's ok if it's all over the place


[02/16/2026 19:25] wintersloop_49457
i really don't mind, this is all i wanted was us to make something together


[02/16/2026 19:26] thesewhitelights
Making something yes, making something intentional, no.  Give me a bit, and I'll talk myself into it.

This feels like you want to make a delicious savory stew for dinner and I showed up with jelly beans and gummy worms and a handful of pebbles I picked up off the ground on my way over, and I'm dumping them in the pot


[02/16/2026 19:30] wintersloop_49457
hahaha i think you just need a different mental model


[02/16/2026 19:31] thesewhitelights
And you are saying, "Yes!  I am happy to get a tummy ache and break my teeth"


[02/16/2026 19:31] wintersloop_49457
it's like i am making a painting with one palette, and then you show up with a different palette, and maybe yes some people might look at it and say "well those don't go together", but i know you made the marks, so i like them


[02/16/2026 19:33] wintersloop_49457
and you know no matter how that painting comes out i'm keeping it


[02/16/2026 19:34] thesewhitelights
I think the barrier is that's now how I listen to music or why I listen to music


[02/16/2026 19:35] thesewhitelights
So I have to learn a knew skill to do this


[02/16/2026 19:35] thesewhitelights
Which I am, but it will take me a while to work it out


[02/16/2026 19:35] wintersloop_49457

[02/16/2026 20:02] thesewhitelights
Did I switch the song?


[02/16/2026 20:02] wintersloop_49457
you probably are just playing a different song on yours

if you left the jam that should bring you back


[02/16/2026 20:03] thesewhitelights
I'm still in


[02/16/2026 20:03] thesewhitelights
I think I clicked on something when the song naturally changed, and I thought I'd done it


[02/16/2026 20:04] wintersloop_49457
ahhh ok


[02/16/2026 20:04] wintersloop_49457
i wonder fi they are not exactly syncronized, does it play ads for you?


[02/16/2026 20:04] thesewhitelights
No ads


[02/16/2026 20:04] wintersloop_49457

How are you feeling?


[02/16/2026 20:25] wintersloop_49457

[02/16/2026 20:26] thesewhitelights
Skin tingly?  Tell me more?


[02/16/2026 20:26] wintersloop_49457
some of the music is giving me goosebumps, but i think because i'm imagining you listen to it


[02/16/2026 20:27] thesewhitelights

I will have to set it aside in about an hour after I'm done with lunch because I'll be covered in chocolate and truffle making


[02/16/2026 20:29] wintersloop_49457
okey 🙂


[02/16/2026 20:32] thesewhitelights
I'm feeling happy and humbled.  My thoughts have been wholly focused on you and us while I've been listening. Physically, I don't have a headache, but I'm dragging a bit.


[02/16/2026 20:38] wintersloop_49457
oh thank you, i appreciate that a lot


[02/16/2026 20:38] wintersloop_49457
why dragging? sleep?


[02/16/2026 20:44] thesewhitelights
I slept well, I think.  Dragging because I've been curled up and comfy and feeling cuddly while listening to your music, and now I have to get up and be focused and precise and active.

yeah i am listening to your song!


[02/16/2026 21:05] thesewhitelights
It stopped playing on my side, hahaha


[02/16/2026 21:06] wintersloop_49457
oh no haha


[02/16/2026 21:06] wintersloop_49457
that reset it for both of us but it's ok i'm digging it


[02/16/2026 21:06] wintersloop_49457
it's a good song


[02/16/2026 21:06] thesewhitelights
Hahaha


[02/16/2026 21:06] thesewhitelights
Sorry


[02/16/2026 21:06] thesewhitelights
I tried


[02/16/2026 21:06] wintersloop_49457
sometimes it messes up like that, i don't think it was your fault


[02/16/2026 21:07] wintersloop_49457
i think what i have done in the past is just click the jam link again and it puts you back into the right state


[02/16/2026 21:07] thesewhitelights
That makes sense


[02/16/2026 21:08] thesewhitelights
Do you know this song?


[02/16/2026 21:09] wintersloop_49457
never heard it but i added it to my favorites, it's great


[02/16/2026 21:10] thesewhitelights
You added it to your favorites!  It felt like it fit the vibe of your playlist (even though I know that's not how I'm supposed to play this game)


[02/16/2026 21:10] wintersloop_49457
haha i mean you can play it like that if you want to stay in that vibe yourself


[02/16/2026 21:10] wintersloop_49457
usually i think people want to show off their favorite music


[02/16/2026 21:11] thesewhitelights
I am not like other people in that way


[02/16/2026 21:11] thesewhitelights

I'm taking a break which I might regret because I'm getting comfortable.  So is Ted on my lap.  I finished the peppermint truffles (the temper was PERFECT).  Next is shaping truffles out of the strawberry ganache and then tempering chocolate to coat the coffee truffles.

[02/17/2026 01:17] thesewhitelights
I am going to have to go out in it if I'm going to finish the truffles tonight.  I failed to recognize that when I dropped the vintage mixing bowl last weekend, I lost half my supply of white chocolate.  I will have naked truffles unless I go to the store.

[02/17/2026 01:22] thesewhitelights
I think I'm going to stay home.  I'm waiting on laundry in the dryer (communal laundry room), and I'm running low on energy already.  The truffles are already "late," so they can wait another day. No big deal.


[02/17/2026 01:33] wintersloop_49457

i think probably i should make a routine, i have not been making my oats

so like wash/brush, oats, get naked, call you

[02/17/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
if i get into bed at 12:15 every night


[02/17/2026 06:34] wintersloop_49457
well, 12:30ish


[02/17/2026 06:34] thesewhitelights
So you can earn your pellets


[02/17/2026 06:35] wintersloop_49457
when you say it like that it sounds like i am a horse


[02/17/2026 06:35] wintersloop_49457
and you have my feed


[02/17/2026 06:35] thesewhitelights
Ted did not appreciate how hard I laughed at that


[02/17/2026 06:35] thesewhitelights
It launched him off my chest


[02/17/2026 06:36] wintersloop_49457

[02/17/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
Multiple times tonight I forgot that this is new


[02/17/2026 06:37] thesewhitelights
Because it feels so known


[02/17/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
yeah i'm in the same spot


[02/17/2026 06:38] wintersloop_49457
this *is* actually my life now


[02/17/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
i'm so glad we have time


[02/17/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
we should keep talking about how to make this good for us


[02/17/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
bedtime is good


[02/17/2026 06:39] wintersloop_49457
we can find more good things i bet


[02/17/2026 06:40] thesewhitelights
I bet we can, too, because we are very good at this

How do you feel?


[02/17/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
i am very happy


[02/17/2026 06:41] wintersloop_49457
and aching for you


[02/17/2026 06:41] thesewhitelights
I know that feeling


[02/17/2026 06:41] thesewhitelights
And that one


[02/17/2026 06:44] wintersloop_49457
i learned a thing a very long time ago that i forgot existed until right now


[02/17/2026 06:44] wintersloop_49457
i will do this for you someday


[02/17/2026 06:44] wintersloop_49457
you have probably done the thing where you lay down, close your eyes, and then start at your toes and flex each muscle you can identify one at a time all the way to the top?


[02/17/2026 06:45] thesewhitelights
yes


[02/17/2026 06:45] wintersloop_49457
ok, well, there is a better version of this


[02/17/2026 06:46] wintersloop_49457
where you have me identify the muscles by gently pressing on them and asking you to flex that one, now that one, now that one, very slowly


[02/17/2026 06:47] wintersloop_49457
you might be naturally / by training very good at this, but having someone touch them can help you find muscles you wouldn't move, plus it is just a nice experience


[02/17/2026 06:47] thesewhitelights
Yes please


[02/17/2026 06:47] wintersloop_49457
yes


[02/17/2026 06:47] thesewhitelights
We used to start almost every class like this in college


[02/17/2026 06:48] thesewhitelights
Full body massage/building awareness through touch


[02/17/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
oh you already know! ok excellent


[02/17/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
you can teach me then


[02/17/2026 06:48] thesewhitelights
But that was a very different context


[02/17/2026 06:48] wintersloop_49457
yes, for sure


[02/17/2026 06:49] wintersloop_49457
it's a really good way to fall asleep


[02/17/2026 06:50] wintersloop_49457
relaxes everything


[02/17/2026 06:50] thesewhitelights
That's why we used it to wake up


[02/17/2026 06:50] wintersloop_49457
that is what made me think of it, because i was thinking of ways we could help each other sleep better


[02/17/2026 06:51] wintersloop_49457
i didn't know this


[02/17/2026 06:51] thesewhitelights
While we're apart?


[02/17/2026 06:51] wintersloop_49457
well, we could do it by speaking, like a guided meditation, but that's not what i meant no


[02/17/2026 06:52] thesewhitelights
I have a very strong suspicion I will sleep like the dead if you are holding me


[02/17/2026 06:52] wintersloop_49457
it's just one of 6 million activities i have been thinking of doing to help you feel good


[02/17/2026 06:52] wintersloop_49457
yes i think so


[02/17/2026 06:55] thesewhitelights
for and to


[02/17/2026 06:55] thesewhitelights
so good for each other and so good to each other


[02/17/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
yes that's the entire idea


[02/17/2026 06:55] wintersloop_49457
we are


[02/17/2026 06:56] wintersloop_49457
that's what i want, for and to


[02/17/2026 06:56] thesewhitelights
me too


[02/17/2026 06:56] wintersloop_49457
ok we are going to build it one day at a time


[02/17/2026 07:00] thesewhitelights
a long time ago I read an interview with a combat veteran.  one of the questions was how was he able to go bravely go head first into such dangerous situations.  He said he was able to do it because his focus was keeping his brothers alive.  His priority was their wellbeing, so he was motivated by that rather than merely self preservation.  And he was able to prioritize having their backs because he knew they were prioritizing having his back.  That reciprocity is what I think is important in a relationship, and we've got that down without even trying.


[02/17/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
YES


[02/17/2026 07:01] wintersloop_49457
this is exactly what i've always wanted


[02/17/2026 07:01] thesewhitelights
You've got me, so I can have you


[02/17/2026 07:02] wintersloop_49457
yeah exactly


[02/17/2026 07:02] wintersloop_49457
we should build up to it


[02/17/2026 07:03] wintersloop_49457
it is a gigantic trust exercise, except we have to catch each other at the same time


[02/17/2026 07:04] thesewhitelights
hahaha, I tried to figure out the physics of that


[02/17/2026 07:04] wintersloop_49457
we could fall back to back, or grab hands before we fall as we pass one another, or use some higher dimensional definition of falling


[02/17/2026 07:05] thesewhitelights
the back to back makes sense


[02/17/2026 07:06] wintersloop_49457
(i may not have entirely thought this metaphor through)


[02/17/2026 07:06] thesewhitelights

it's the best thing anyone is ever going to say about me

it's a true statement


[02/17/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
i guess now that you mention it i don't want to be with anyone else, so


[02/17/2026 07:14] wintersloop_49457
we're doomed


[02/17/2026 07:15] thesewhitelights
I imagine with Carl's blessing, too


[02/17/2026 07:15] wintersloop_49457
yes he approves


[02/17/2026 07:15] wintersloop_49457
we are very much followers of his creed


[02/17/2026 07:16] thesewhitelights
I like this


[02/17/2026 07:17] wintersloop_49457
there was a brief period of time that i had "saganism" listed as my religion on social media but then i looked at my sisters and brothers and thought maybe i need to just do this on my own


[02/17/2026 07:18] wintersloop_49457
we can do it on our own


[02/17/2026 07:18] thesewhitelights
together


[02/17/2026 07:18] wintersloop_49457
> Saganism is a philosophy and worldview inspired by the late astronomer and science communicator Carl Sagan. It emphasizes scientific skepticism, curiosity, environmental stewardship, and a profound, often spiritual, awe of the cosmos. It advocates for rational inquiry, compassion, and the pursuit of knowledge while rejecting pseudoscience, nationalism, and narrow-mindedness.


[02/17/2026 07:18] wintersloop_49457

You were in a dream last night.  I didn't see you, but I know you were in it.  You told me you were getting a haircut!


[02/17/2026 14:19] wintersloop_49457
i don't even know when the last time i got a haircut was


[02/17/2026 14:20] wintersloop_49457

[02/17/2026 14:20] wintersloop_49457
did we wake up at the same time


[02/17/2026 14:20] wintersloop_49457

so, maybe what your dream was telling you though


[02/17/2026 14:24] wintersloop_49457
is that i love it when people shave my head for me


[02/17/2026 14:25] wintersloop_49457
shaving it myself is something i don't like doing and i have to do it fairly often


[02/17/2026 14:25] thesewhitelights
I will learn.


[02/17/2026 14:25] wintersloop_49457
it's so easy, i don't us a razor just the buzzer


[02/17/2026 14:26] wintersloop_49457
it's much easier for someone who can actually see the back of my head!


[02/17/2026 14:26] thesewhitelights
I will stand on a stool

[02/17/2026 14:32] wintersloop_49457
me too


[02/17/2026 14:36] wintersloop_49457
have you ever heard of the claude constitution


[02/17/2026 14:36] thesewhitelights
I don't believe so


[02/17/2026 14:36] wintersloop_49457
in AI there is something called the alignment problem


[02/17/2026 14:37] wintersloop_49457
which is two problems at once


[02/17/2026 14:37] wintersloop_49457
we're trying to describe what computers should do for people, all people


[02/17/2026 14:37] wintersloop_49457
and the problems become 1. how do you even describe what everyone wants and 2. how do you literally use the right words so that it is not misunderstood


[02/17/2026 14:38] wintersloop_49457
no monkeys paw anywhere, basically


[02/17/2026 14:38] wintersloop_49457
so the claude constitution is the first public document that any of the big AI companies have put out that's trying to do this


[02/17/2026 14:39] wintersloop_49457
it's interesting from the perspective of seeing how to generically describe to a computer how to act in the interests of a person, build ethics from scratch essentially


[02/17/2026 14:40] wintersloop_49457
i thought of it related to what i woke up thinking about, which is how would i put the words down of what it is you and i do?


[02/17/2026 14:40] wintersloop_49457
and then i realized it would be a *huge* document, and also not actually work


[02/17/2026 14:41] wintersloop_49457
and that's basically what the claude constitution is as well haha

did you know that a single squirrel may put away around 10,000 nuts in various hiding places over the course of a season


[02/17/2026 14:52] wintersloop_49457
and there are so many places that they forget about 20% of them, and this is one of the ways trees maintain a healthy amount of mobility


[02/17/2026 14:53] thesewhitelights
Did you know that when I buy gingins (hard ginger candies), I stash them in many places so future Amy can find them unexpectedly and have a treat?


[02/17/2026 14:53] wintersloop_49457
you make a very good squirrel


[02/17/2026 14:53] wintersloop_49457

HI. HELLO THERE. Yes, please.


[02/17/2026 18:55] thesewhitelights
I'm feeling good this morning. No headache for now. I just finished my 1:1, and I kept giggling because I was thinking about our call last night. Before that meeting, I stopped by Aubrey & Ashley's office to deliver truffles and get hugs. Aubrey was there, and I told her about you and us, and she understands it like we understand it without additional explanation.  She literally melted on the floor (as an interpreter, she's very animated hahaha)

you're my favorite person


[02/17/2026 19:56] wintersloop_49457
planhub (my only client) wants me to go work for them fulltime and i'm seriously considering it


[02/17/2026 19:57] wintersloop_49457
it may mean screwing over dan/juan, which is problematic, but it might also be the best thing for me


[02/17/2026 19:59] wintersloop_49457
also can i have your permission: if any of my friends ask for a picture of you, i will show them this dead fish picture of you?


[02/17/2026 20:44] thesewhitelights
This is exciting news! Lots to consider though.

Yes, you can, hahaha

Wow! signal
The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal detected on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and bore expected hallmarks of extraterrestri...

[02/17/2026 20:58] wintersloop_49457
insanely, it happened the same year that they launched the probe


[02/17/2026 21:18] wintersloop_49457
agree with the premise, but highlight that the golden record was a long shot -> but the best part got left out -> same summer 1977 a guy in ohio found a signal so clean he just wrote wow (in the margin!) -> then it was gone and nobody ever found it again -> that's the whole point though right, the silence after is the argument for grabbing hold now -> fumble the metaphor a little, your poem is my signal or wait my poem is your signal, one of us is the signal -> pick up the godel thing and finish it, two systems can prove what one can't alone -> the poem landed in mine like it was already supposed to be there -> i don't want to spend years pointing at where you used to be -> hi i'm mike i once skipped my own birthday party at my own house on purpose, let's not miss this, i've been listening for you


[02/17/2026 21:18] wintersloop_49457
would you like me to write this for you?


[02/17/2026 21:31] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to exec coaching and then stopping by ian's to talk to him about some business related stuff, i should be back home between 5 and 6 your time


[02/17/2026 21:36] thesewhitelights
I hope the afternoon treats you well. I'll send a message before I leave for Zumba (5:30ish my time). I've been thinking about you, and I'm still listening.


[02/17/2026 21:39] wintersloop_49457
i'm still listening


[02/18/2026 00:41] wintersloop_49457
they upgraded my building's keyless entry system and it now requires use of a smartphone lol


[02/18/2026 00:56] thesewhitelights
I've been envious of your phone and have been wondering about it because so many things now require mobile apps.  How will you get in?


[02/18/2026 00:56] wintersloop_49457
i forwarded the email to ari and he is now the keyholder


[02/18/2026 00:56] wintersloop_49457
i asked my HOA about this a month ago and they never responded, i forgot about it


[02/18/2026 00:56] wintersloop_49457
the system upgrade happened while i was out today


[02/18/2026 00:57] wintersloop_49457
they are going to have to figure something out for me 🤷🏻‍♂️

My insides feel warm.  This is your fault.

[02/18/2026 01:38] wintersloop_49457
i'm going to do my saber dancing while you do your dancing


[02/18/2026 03:12] thesewhitelights
How are you feeling?


[02/18/2026 03:12] wintersloop_49457
tired, how are you


[02/18/2026 03:13] thesewhitelights
Also tired.  My muscles are going to be sore tomorrow.


[02/18/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
that's a good thing


[02/18/2026 03:14] wintersloop_49457
i'd rub them if i could


[02/18/2026 03:17] thesewhitelights
It is good.  In your absence, I'll soak in the bath.


[02/18/2026 03:18] wintersloop_49457
that's a nice picture


[02/18/2026 03:24] thesewhitelights
What have you been doing?  I giggled no fewer than 2 times during the class while thinking of you  doing your saber dancing.


[02/18/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
i haven't been playing often enough and it's difficult for me to do the expert+ songs now, there's a bad bunny song on there i haven't beat yet but it's like


[02/18/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
play the song, and then pant for 5 minutes, and then try again


[02/18/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
i need to get back into doing it every day


[02/18/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
that's basically what i've been doing


[02/18/2026 03:25] wintersloop_49457
now i am chilling on the couch but i should take a shower


[02/18/2026 03:26] wintersloop_49457
i will have to at some point before bed


[02/18/2026 03:26] thesewhitelights
Is it a pellet?


[02/18/2026 03:27] wintersloop_49457
the pellet is just any concerted exercise


[02/18/2026 03:27] wintersloop_49457
which to me means at least 30 min of elevated heart rate


[02/18/2026 03:27] thesewhitelights
What color is it?


[02/18/2026 03:27] wintersloop_49457
yellow


[02/18/2026 03:29] wintersloop_49457
amy = blue
water = baby blue
exercise = yellow
sleep = green
go outside = orange
take meds = purple
socialize = white
only healthy food all day = pink


[02/18/2026 03:31] thesewhitelights
Does talking with me count as socializing?


[02/18/2026 03:31] wintersloop_49457
no


[02/18/2026 03:32] wintersloop_49457
we are merging ourselves into one social entity haha


[02/18/2026 03:32] thesewhitelights
smooshy smooshy together


[02/18/2026 03:32] wintersloop_49457
yes please


[02/18/2026 03:33] wintersloop_49457
have you seen, or seen trailers for Together


[02/18/2026 03:34] thesewhitelights
I've seen the image of their mouths melted together


[02/18/2026 03:34] wintersloop_49457
yea, like that


[02/18/2026 03:34] thesewhitelights
I'm in


[02/18/2026 03:34] wintersloop_49457

[02/18/2026 03:37] thesewhitelights
I like our shape

koala backpack friends


[02/18/2026 03:43] thesewhitelights
Would you like to talk on a call a little later?  Or would you like to try to stay separate and see how that feels?


[02/18/2026 03:44] wintersloop_49457
my preference is to talk to you every night, but i will never have a problem it if you want time alone


[02/18/2026 03:47] wintersloop_49457
maybe sometimes i will feel like i need time alone, but have not felt like that yet


[02/18/2026 03:48] thesewhitelights
I feel the same way


[02/18/2026 03:49] thesewhitelights
As in together yes, but alone time is also perfectly okay


[02/18/2026 03:50] wintersloop_49457
yes, i think we are both squarely in the "everyone should always feel free to do what makes them happy, or they feel they need" camp


[02/18/2026 03:50] wintersloop_49457
and also, cannot stop thinking about one another


[02/18/2026 03:50] wintersloop_49457
it's a good situation, generally


[02/18/2026 03:53] thesewhitelights
I cannot stop thinking about you.

oh the wow signal


[02/18/2026 04:03] wintersloop_49457
did you see what i wrote


[02/18/2026 04:03] thesewhitelights
I was just rereading it


[02/18/2026 04:03] thesewhitelights
Literally this second


[02/18/2026 04:05] thesewhitelights
When I read it this morning, my thought was it would have taken me one million years to respond, and I wouldn't know what to say.  I'm grateful you posted so I got to message you first.


[02/18/2026 04:08] wintersloop_49457
you mean in the hypothetical, you wouldn't have known how to respond when i sent it to you?


[02/18/2026 04:10] thesewhitelights
Yes, if I was on the receiving end of that first message from you, it would have taken me a very long time to carefully compose a response


[02/18/2026 04:13] wintersloop_49457
thank god we made it through this part already


[02/18/2026 04:13] wintersloop_49457
i am so grateful that whatever needed to happen in your head at just the right moment happened


[02/18/2026 04:14] wintersloop_49457
also i followed you on duolingo just now, and i told you we could set up times to practice this week, which i think is another Good Thing™ we can do for one another


[02/18/2026 04:19] thesewhitelights
When Renee asked me what you brought for show-and-tell on our date and I mentioned your jar, she said you should have a pellet for Duolingo


[02/18/2026 04:19] wintersloop_49457
yes maybe


[02/18/2026 04:19] thesewhitelights
She tries to get everyone to join Duolingo


[02/18/2026 04:19] wintersloop_49457
i think that it should be generalized to brain exercises


[02/18/2026 04:19] wintersloop_49457
mental exercise


[02/18/2026 04:20] wintersloop_49457
but then i already do this all day


[02/18/2026 04:20] thesewhitelights
You're already on level 5?!


[02/18/2026 04:20] wintersloop_49457
yes?


[02/18/2026 04:20] wintersloop_49457
i only did it for like a total of 20 min maybe


[02/18/2026 04:20] wintersloop_49457
the day i signed up and then just now


[02/18/2026 04:21] wintersloop_49457
i take it that's good


[02/18/2026 04:23] thesewhitelights
I think that's impressive


[02/18/2026 04:23] thesewhitelights
I need to do mine


[02/18/2026 04:23] thesewhitelights
I'm in a friends quest with Susan, and Susan never carries her weight but we love her anyway


[02/18/2026 04:25] wintersloop_49457
something about the "level" is not right


[02/18/2026 04:25] wintersloop_49457
i have 91xp and you have 327470xp


[02/18/2026 04:26] thesewhitelights
That's because when I was on a mission to achieve Rarest Diamond, I had to grind and grind and grind because my elo was really high, so I was in leagues with people who had ridiculous daily XP levels


[02/18/2026 04:26] wintersloop_49457
it's got to be that it takes more xp every level to go up, so you level up slower as the level gets higher


[02/18/2026 04:26] thesewhitelights
So I did a bunch of the practice exercises instead of actual lessons


[02/18/2026 04:27] wintersloop_49457
i'll advance quickly through low levels and then slow down as i get higher


[02/18/2026 04:27] wintersloop_49457
ooh ok


[02/18/2026 04:29] thesewhitelights
Rarest Diamond means getting 1st place in Diamond league


[02/18/2026 04:29] thesewhitelights
It was my life's goal, so really I can die now


[02/18/2026 04:30] wintersloop_49457
not yet plz


[02/18/2026 04:30] wintersloop_49457
i have a few things to show you first


[02/18/2026 04:33] thesewhitelights
It felt wrong just typing it out.  I have greater goals now.

[02/18/2026 04:43] wintersloop_49457
or do you want to just talk for 30 min here before bed?


[02/18/2026 04:44] wintersloop_49457
or both!

```
The thing about the Golden Record
is that it was always a long shot.
You press a heartbeat into gold
you throw it past Jupiter
and you hope.

But here's the part you left out.

That same summer 1977
the air still warm in Ohio
a man scanning the sky
for exactly the kind of thing
no one expects to find
found it.

A signal. Seventy-two seconds.
So clear he circled it on the printout
and wrote one word in the margin

Wow!

Then it was gone.
They aimed every dish they had
at that same patch of sky for years.
Nothing. One signal. One moment.
The kind of thing
that if you weren't already listening
you would have missed entirely.

I think about this a lot.
Not the signal. The silence after.
How the whole argument for paying attention
is that the thing you are waiting for
will not announce itself twice.

So your poem is my signal.
Or my poem is your signal.
One of us is definitely the signal
we can sort out the metaphor later.

You said a guy wrote 700 pages
proving that a system
can't prove its own most interesting truths.
Which means the only way to learn
what you can't say alone
is to find a system
that finishes your sentences.

Your poem landed in mine
like a frequency in a dish
that was already aimed
in exactly the right direction.
I would like to not spend years
pointing at the place you used to be.

So. Hi.
I'm Mike. 40. Pittsburgh.
I once skipped my own birthday party
that my friends threw for me
at my own house
on purpose.
Let's not miss this signal.
```


[02/18/2026 04:50] thesewhitelights

no homework for amy

I was thinking earlier about our reading plans.  We (at least I) will need time to read if we're reading separately, and that's time we won't be together


[02/18/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457
yes true


[02/18/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457
we will see how it feels


[02/18/2026 07:11] wintersloop_49457
to me sharing books is very intimate
