thank god
the banana
won't set

now we can stay up
taking each other apart

she opens me
like a book
she's already read twice

leafing each page gently
even though it's ok
to dog-ear them,
to leave marks
in the margins

I open her
the same way

this is not a metaphor
for anything else
except it is
so neither of us
gets dressed
