The thing about the Golden Record
is that it was always a long shot.
You press a heartbeat into gold
you throw it past Jupiter
and you hope.

But there's a part you left out.

That same summer 1977
the air still warm in Ohio
a man scanning the sky
for exactly the kind of thing
no one expects to find
found it.

A signal. Seventy-two seconds.
So clear he circled it on the printout
and wrote one word in the margin

Wow!

Then it was gone.
They aimed every dish they had
at that same patch of sky for years.
Nothing. One signal. One moment.
The kind of thing
that if you weren't already listening
you would have missed entirely.

I think about this a lot.
Not the signal. The silence after.
How the whole argument for paying attention
is that the thing you are waiting for
will not announce itself twice.

So your poem is my signal.
Or my poem is your signal.
One of us is definitely the signal
we can sort out the metaphor later.

You said a guy wrote 700 pages
proving that a system
can't prove its own most interesting truths.
Which means the only way to learn
what you can't say alone
is to find a system
that finishes your sentences.

Your poem landed in mine
like a frequency in a dish
that was already aimed
in exactly the right direction.
I would like to not spend years
pointing at the place you used to be.

So. Hi.
I'm Mike. 40. Pittsburgh.
I once skipped my own birthday party
that my friends threw for me
at my own house
on purpose.
Let's not miss this signal.
