I'm writing a poem on r4r
which is either the bravest or most unhinged
thing I've ever done on the internet
and I once mass-replied to a Craigslist ad
looking for bandmates by sending
a three-minute video of myself
playing recorder badly on purpose.
So the bar was already low.
And yet here we are.

The scariest thing I've done
is kept starting over.
Dropped out of college, built companies,
sold one, watched another one end,
sat in therapy for twenty years
learning how to say "I want things"
without making it sound like an apology.

There's a book about a guy who proved
that every system complex enough to describe itself
will contain things it can't prove about itself.
It's 700 pages. It changed how I think
about thinking. It won't come up on a first date
unless you want it to.

Here is a fun fact
that has no business being this romantic.
In 1977 NASA built a golden record
and launched it into interstellar space, hoping
that someday an alien civilization
would find it and hear what we sound like.
They put music on it. Greetings
in 55 languages. Whale songs.
And the heartbeat of a woman
named Ann Druyan, recorded
the day she realized she was in love
with Carl Sagan.
(I am not making this up.
I would not know how to make this up.)

So if aliens ever find proof
that humans were real,
part of that proof is a crush.
Which might be the only hard evidence
that soulmates exist.
The only problem is
I can't afford an interstellar probe,
so you're getting a poem instead.

I'm Mike. 40. Pittsburgh.
I cook elaborate meals that vanish in minutes
and write poems I'm too scared to sign.
I think soulmates are built, not found.
I'm sort of banking on that right now.
