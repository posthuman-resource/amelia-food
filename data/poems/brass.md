most of the day I can't hear you
I send words. you send them back
this is what we have: language
which is far from nothing
which is also not your mouth

our friendship lasted one day
before it grew into something
big enough to leave unnamed
and it requires instruments
we do not have

fingers mouths skin
which are not instruments at all
but subjects
making legible the words
we cannot speak
or not even that
they are the message

I am still listening
I want so badly to tell you
