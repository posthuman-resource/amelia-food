i would rather hear you
describe a truffle you ruined
than taste the best one
anyone else ever made

i would rather hear you
play the tuba in my kitchen
at 6am on a sunday
than be serenaded
by any normal person

i would rather give you
the kind of sleep
where nothing gets in
than ever rest well

i would rather sit with you
when you're prickly and sick
and not wanting to be touched
than be held by anyone else

i would rather watch you
figure out emoji
than read anyone else's
love letters

i would rather be
the one who noticed
the breadcrumb

i would rather be late
to everything else

i would rather
amy
