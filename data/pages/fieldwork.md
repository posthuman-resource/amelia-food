I have never held anyone whose body I first had to build out of questions. Nine questions over two nights, assembled in the dark of two separate time zones like furniture instructions where the drawings don't match the screws. What side of the bed. What noise in the room. What on the body is okay to touch and what belongs to the cat. I have a complete schematic of a woman I have never been in the same room with, and now I am in the same room with her, and the schematic is wrong, the way all schematics are wrong, because a person is not a blueprint. A person is warm. Specifically this one is not warm. She told me she runs cold with the same directness she uses for everything, the way she'd tell you she knows the secret recipe for a protected ice cream flavor or that she once made a grad student cry by asking a single follow-up question. Just information. Here it is. Do with it what you will.

She is in the bathroom. I am standing next to the bed like a man who has just been shown to his table at a restaurant and forgotten how chairs work. Which side. She told me she takes the far side, away from the door, which I understood immediately and have been thinking about ever since. I should get in. I should just get in. I am a grown man who has operated a bed before.

I take the side closest to the door and lie there like a diagram of myself.

The fan is on. It has been on since before I got here. I think it has been on for years. It is a box fan, not elegant, not trying to be elegant, planted on the floor like a small headstone to privacy. It is the loudest thing in the room besides my own pulse, and it is doing important work I didn't understand until right now, because without it I can hear the building. Not in the way you hear a building settle. In the way you hear a building _live_. Someone upstairs is doing something to a mattress, or a mattress is doing something to itself, a low arrhythmic rumble she once described to me in a fifteen-minute story involving three upstairs neighbors she called Grandpa One, Grandpa Two, and Grandpa Three, each with a different policy on vibrating mattress pads, and by the time she finished the story I understood that the story was not about the mattress. It was about how long she has been lying here, solving things by herself, and the fan was the solution, and she never asked anyone to come up with a better one.

She comes out of the bathroom and gets into bed the way I imagine she has gotten into this bed three thousand times. It is a practiced motion. She crosses to the far side without looking at me and pulls the quilt to her chin even though it is not cold, even though I am here and I am essentially a space heater that has been granted personhood. She lies on her side facing away from me. The back of her neck is right there.

We are both naked. I know this about her already. We learned this about each other at six in the morning in the amber glow of our separate laptop screens when she asked if I wore pajamas and then, before I could volley the question back, said _me too_, and then said _you can ignore my answer if you didn't want to know that_, as if there were a version of me in any timeline who did not want to know that. I have been aware of this fact about her for fifty-nine days. Fifty-nine days of knowing and now the knowing is in the same bed as me and I don't know where to put my hands, which is new, because I always know where to put my hands. I am a person who fixes things. I reach for tools. My hands are not confused by objects. But she is not an object. She is a warm thing that is somehow also cold, and she is right there, and my hands are just hands.

I put my arm over her waist because she said yes to this. She said yes to all of it, actually, waist and shoulders and neck, _yes?_ with a question mark, not because she was uncertain but because she is a rhetorician and rhetoricians do not commit to claims without sufficient evidence. She was being _precise_. She did not have recent data. When I asked if she liked to talk during cuddle time she said _I do not know_, and I heard a woman who would rather say nothing than say something inaccurate, which is the most her thing she has ever done. The experiment had been on hiatus. Nobody had applied for the grant in over a decade. But the lab was still there. The equipment was good.

So we are conducting new research.

I pull her toward me and her back touches my chest, and it is like putting your hand on a door and releasing that the room behind it is much larger than you expected. She is small. She told me this early, _I am small_, the way you'd say _I am left-handed_ or _I once ran an ice cream shop_, which she also did, and also told me in the same matter-of-fact way, as if a woman who knows the secret recipe for Blue Moon ice cream and was sworn to silence by a fraternity of soda jerks is the kind of thing that just happens to people. She is small but her back is a whole landscape. I can feel the scoliosis she told me about, the slight lopsidedness she said was only noticeable if you examined her back or watched her bowl. I am examining her back. I would also like to watch her bowl.

Her muscles are extraordinary. Not in the way people mean when they say that about someone who lifts weights. In the way that twenty years of dancing will engineer a body into something that knows exactly where it is in space at all times, that can hold a position until the position gives up first. Her back is a testament to discipline I will never have. Her lower back is so tight it is practically a political stance. I press and it pushes back with the quiet authority of a woman who has been holding herself together on purpose, because she is good at it, because she decided to be. I press harder. She makes a sound I have not heard before. I will spend a significant portion of my remaining years trying to hear it again.

Something is walking on my legs.

Ted. I forgot about Ted. He was on her shoulder when I arrived, her left shoulder, his spot, which tonight is my spot, and he has been negotiating this transition with the resignation of a middle manager whose office has been reassigned. He is standing on my calf now, very deliberately, with the full weight of a cat who steals lettuce off sandwiches and runs away with it flapping from his mouth like a conquered flag. He circles twice. He settles on my ankles. He begins to purr in short bursts, like a car that won't quite turn over. Fine. Ankles. I'll take ankles, Theodore. We can revisit this in the morning.

Her hair is in my face. I am not going to move it. Her hair smells like something I was promised and have been waiting fifty-nine days to verify. Blue Moon ice cream. I asked her what her hair smelled like and she told me, because I ask her everything and she tells me everything, and then she told me she knows the secret recipe because she accidentally figured it out in her uncle's ice cream shop, and that the flavor is classified, and I have been waiting to smell classified information with my whole face ever since. She told me her hair _can_ smell like this, emphasis on the _can_, like she was listing a feature on a spec sheet for a product she wasn't sure I'd buy. I bought it fifty-nine days ago. I have been waiting for the shipment.

Now.

The arm.

My left arm is under her neck. This was a choice I made three minutes ago and cannot unmake. It is the arm problem. It is the oldest problem in the history of two people lying down together. Older than language. Older than fire. Some Neanderthal put his arm under someone's neck forty thousand years ago and thought _this was a mistake_ and didn't move it and his descendants inherited both the instinct and the nerve damage. My arm is between her neck and the pillow and it is already beginning to tingle. I give it forty minutes before it is fully dead. I'm not moving it.

She shifts. Pushes back against me a half inch. Recalibrates. I am so hot. Thermally. I am a furnace, I have always been a furnace, and she is cold, she is always cold, and between us we are one working thermostat for the first time in either of our lives. All this heat I've been hauling around. All those nights of kicking off blankets. It was never mine. It was cargo. She's the delivery address and she's been freezing and I've been burning and the whole thing is so stupid and so obvious that I want to laugh but I don't because she's breathing differently now and I think something important is happening in her shoulders.

They're dropping. One millimeter. Maybe two. She holds her shoulders at ear level. I know this because I have thought about her shoulders more than is strictly sane, because she told me once that she carries tension in them the way other people carry wallets, always, everywhere, can't leave the house without it. And they are coming down. Whatever she is letting go of, she is letting go of it at a rate of about one millimeter per minute, and it is the most important thing happening on this planet right now and no one can see it but me. And possibly Ted, who has opinions about everything.

The noodle thing. She warned me about this. She said there was something dangerous about pulling out all the stops, that she'd turn into a noodle before a ninja, and I said I'd never known how much I liked noodles, and she said, _you don't know you like noodles now._ She was wrong about that. I knew then. I know better now. She is softening against me, not collapsing but _deciding_, the way she decides everything, deliberately and completely. She has chosen to allow this. I have my hand on her lower back, pressing, not to fix anything because I am not qualified to fix anything, just to be the thing the muscles can lean into while they figure out what it feels like to have a second opinion.

The rumbling upstairs gets louder for a second. Ted flicks an ear. The fan handles it. I am learning the acoustic architecture of her life. The fan covers the building. The building covers the neighborhood. Somewhere out there the Palouse is doing whatever it does at night, which in April I imagine is being green and treeless and rolling in every direction like an ocean made of wheat that hasn't decided what color to be yet. She complains about the trees, or the lack of them. Miles of hills and not a decent tree for miles, just lentils and experimental apples designed by the university she works at. I haven't seen it yet. I came in after dark, past the lock she's only forgotten twice in thirteen years.

She might be talking. It might be breathing. It might be that she is telling the quilt about its evening, because this is a woman who answers _what does your bedroom sound like_ with a three-act play, and I would not put it past her to narrate her own falling asleep. I don't interrupt. We are generating new data. We are running the experiment. The hypothesis is that two people who built each other out of questions in the middle of the night can lie here in the answer and not be disappointed, and so far the results are good. The results are so good.

My arm is dead. Fully dead. The blood has left it for a better life elsewhere in my body. I can feel my heartbeat in my shoulder and absolutely nothing below it. I should move. I should slide it out, shake it off, let the pins and needles do their work. She would understand. She's asleep, she might not even notice. She is asleep. I know because her hand, which at some point migrated on top of mine, has gone heavy in the specific way a hand goes heavy when the person it belongs to has decided you can stay. She is a woman who makes decisions like this, cleanly, the way she left a career and became someone new, the way she knits a row and doesn't go back. She decided I could be here, on this side of the door, inside the hum of this fan and this building and this life she has built and maintained for thirteen years without anyone's help, and then she fell asleep, which is the most trust anyone has ever placed in me.

My arm is so dead I will not be able to use it tomorrow.

I don't move it.

Outside, the fan drones. Ted purrs from my ankles in stacato. The building rumbles and settles. And something I built out of nine questions and two time zones and fifty-nine days of not ignoring a single thing she said breathes against my chest, and is warm, and is here.

The arm can wait.
