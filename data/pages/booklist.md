building, making, and why we won't stop

- **gödel, escher, bach** by hofstadter, this is the book where self-reference and strange loops stopped being abstract concepts and started feeling personal to me. it's about how systems that refer to themselves create something that looks a lot like consciousness, and it changed how i think about thinking. it's long and dense and completely worth it

- **what technology wants** by kevin kelly, the closest anyone has come to explaining why some people can't stop building things even when they don't know what they're building yet. i have never been able to not make things, and this book made me feel less weird about that

- **the science of can and can't** by marletto, instead of asking what _is_, she asks what _could be_, and makes a really compelling case that possibility is more fundamental than actuality. it reframed a lot of how i think about physics and honestly about engineering too

- **educated** by tara westover, proof that you can build yourself from scratch when the original blueprint was garbage. she grew up in a survivalist family with no formal education and ended up at cambridge. it's brutal and beautiful and i think about it a lot

- **red mars** by kim stanley robinson, terraforming as the ultimate blank canvas problem. what happens when you give engineers a whole planet and they immediately start arguing about what it should become. it's a novel but it reads like the most interesting meeting you've ever sat in on

- **the fountainhead** by ayn rand, i know, i know. but this one is about what it means to be someone who makes versus someone who takes, and it arrives at some complicated counterintuitive conclusions about each. it's worth reading even if you end up disagreeing with half of it, which i do

what it's like to be anything at all

- **being you** by anil seth, the hard problem of consciousness is the most important question almost nobody takes seriously. this book takes it seriously. it's about how your brain constructs your entire experience of reality, and it made me genuinely uncomfortable in the best way

- **god, human, animal, machine** by o'gieblyn, she used to study theology and now she's asking the same questions about AI that she used to ask about god, and the parallels are uncomfortably familiar. this one hit close to home for me given everything i think about with AI and meaning

- **the stranger** by camus, a man feels nothing about anything and somehow the book means everything by it. it's very short and very french and it will sit in your head for weeks

- **an anthropologist on mars** by oliver sacks, case studies of people whose cognition went somewhere extraordinary, and what that reveals about how ordinary cognition works. sacks writes about his patients with so much warmth and curiosity that it never feels clinical

- **why does the world exist?** by jim holt, he takes the question "why is there anything at all?" and actually pursues it, talks to physicists and philosophers and theologians, and never quite arrives at an answer, which is kind of the point

wonder and terror

- **when we cease to understand the world** by labatut, scientists who got too close to the truth and it cost them everything. it blurs fact and fiction so seamlessly you stop being able to tell which is which. the writing is extraordinary

- **the maniac** by benjamin labatut, same method but this time it's von neumann. this book is the closest thing to the kind of book i want to write. it's about genius and the terrible things genius makes possible, and it's formally inventive in a way that serves the story perfectly

- **exhalation** by ted chiang, every story is a thought experiment that makes you feel something you didn't expect to feel. he uses science the way poets use metaphor, except the science is real and the feelings are realer. i think you would love this one

- **annihilation** by vandermeer, a novel that works exactly like the thing it describes. it changes you and you can't really explain how. the writing does something to your perception that i've never experienced in another book

- **contact** by sagan, the real question was never "are we alone" but "would it matter if we weren't." it's technically sci-fi but it's really about faith and evidence and what we do when the universe actually answers back

- **hyperphantasia** by akant, what happens when imagination becomes so vivid it stops being metaphorical. perception as a haunting. this one is weird and i loved it

love, longing, and the distance between people

- **letters to a young poet** by rilke, solitude described so precisely it stops feeling lonely and starts feeling necessary. he writes about patience and creativity and love in a way that feels like someone handing you permission to be exactly who you are. i think about this book when i think about you

- **on earth we're briefly gorgeous** by ocean vuong, a novel made of poems, or poems arranged into a novel. tenderness and violence doing something together that neither could do alone. the language in this is so careful and so devastating

- **priestdaddy** by lockwood, sardonic and sincere in the same breath, and you never quite know which is which. she grew up in a rectory with her dad who was a catholic priest (long story) and the memoir is hilarious and strange and deeply felt

- **no one is talking about this** by patricia lockwood, a novel about the internet that becomes a novel about grief so fast it gives you whiplash. the first half is funny and the second half destroyed me. she's one of my favorite writers and this is a big reason why

- **the unbearable lightness of being** by kundera, weight is what gives life meaning, and some people carry more of it than others. it's about love and politics and the body and whether repetition makes things matter more or less. it's one of those books that meets you differently depending on when you read it

- **cloud cuckoo land** by anthony doerr, stories separated by centuries that are really about the same thing: the need to preserve something beautiful before it disappears. it's about libraries and war and children and the stubborn belief that words can survive anything

nothing mattering, beautifully

- **amusing ourselves to death** by postman, written in 1985 and more true every single year. it explains why someone who builds technology for a living would also be deeply worried about what technology does to people. huxley was right, not orwell. that's the thesis and it's correct

- **determined** by robert sapolsky, the most rigorous case against free will currently available, and somehow reading it makes you kinder instead of more nihilistic. he walks you through neuroscience and biology and behavior until the idea that anyone "chose" anything starts to feel a little absurd. i found it weirdly comforting

- **the rigor of angels** by egginton, borges, kant, and heisenberg walk into a book about the limits of human knowledge. it shouldn't work but it does. it's about what we can and can't know and why the boundary between those two things is where all the interesting stuff happens

- **how to change your mind** by michael pollan, it's not really about psychedelics, it's about what happens when the default mode network in your brain shuts up for five minutes and you meet whoever is underneath. the neuroscience sections are the best parts

survival and trust

- **piranesi** by susanna clarke, a man alone in an impossible house, keeping meticulous records of everything he sees. it's about the dignity of paying careful attention to a world that doesn't explain itself. i think you would understand this character immediately

- **the left hand of darkness** by le guin, ostensibly about an ice planet where gender is fluid. actually about what it takes to trust one other person completely. the relationship at the center of this book is one of the most honest depictions of intimacy i've ever read, and i mean intimacy in the broadest sense

falling in and not coming back for a while

- **ficciones** by borges, short stories that feel like mathematical proofs. libraries containing every possible book, gardens where time forks, maps that become the territory. borges is the writer i return to most often because every story teaches me something new about how ideas can be structured

- **if on a winter's night a traveler** by calvino, a novel about trying to read a novel. it's self-referential in a way that makes you want to try the same trick in a different medium. playful and smart and somehow also genuinely romantic

- **the metamorphosis** by kafka, it's not about a man turning into a bug. it's about what happens to the people around him, which is worse. you'll read it in an afternoon and think about it for a very long time

- **blood meridian** by cormac mccarthy, the most beautiful prose ever written about the most terrible things. his sentences feel like weather. i can't recommend this to everyone because it's genuinely harrowing, but the writing is a thing i aspire to at the sentence level

- **pale fire** by nabokov, a poem with a commentary that devours the poem. the unreliable narrator to end all unreliable narrators. it's a puzzle box and a tragedy and one of the most formally inventive novels ever written

- **waiting for godot** by beckett, two people wait for someone who never comes, and somehow it's the funniest and saddest thing ever written. you can read it in an hour and it will rearrange something in your chest
