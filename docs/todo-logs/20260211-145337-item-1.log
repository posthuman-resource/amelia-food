Perfect! ✨ I've successfully implemented the table surface textures. Here's what was created:

## Completed Work

Added three texture classes to `app/globals.css`:

1. **`.texture-wood`** - Wood grain texture with:
   - Horizontal grain pattern (like viewing a table from above)
   - Layered CSS gradients in warm browns (#8B7355, #6B5B45, #A89070)
   - SVG noise overlay for micro-texture
   - Seamlessly tiling design

2. **`.texture-paper`** - Paper/parchment texture with:
   - Warm cream base color (#FAF7F2)
   - Subtle fiber texture using SVG feTurbulence
   - Perfect for cards and modal overlays

3. **`.texture-noise`** - Warmth overlay with:
   - Pseudo-element implementation
   - SVG fractal noise with low opacity
   - Adds organic feel without being distracting

All textures use inline SVG data URIs (no external files), are lightweight, and tile seamlessly. The build passes successfully ✓

**Next step:** Run `/todo done` to remove this completed item and move on to the next task!
